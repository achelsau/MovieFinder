By Michael Bloomberg\'s election as mayor in 2001, a massive speculative real estate boom is rapidly altering the neighborhoods she has come to call home. She watches as an explosion of luxury housing and chain store development spurs bitter conflict over who has a right to live in the city and to determine its future. While some people view these development patterns as ultimately revitalizing the city, to others, they are erasing the eclectic urban fabric, economic and racial diversity, creative alternative culture, and unique local economies that drew them to Brooklyn in the first place.

Kang-Il (Ko Soo) is a dedicated firefighter, who doesn\'t blink when it comes to saving someone else\'s life. Emotionally, Kang-Il still carries heavy grief over the death of his own wife. Outside of work, Kang-Il rarely socializes with others. Firefighter Kang-Il was also at the hospital when the wife, who was misdiagnosed by Mi-Soo, became gravely ill. His boss ordered Kang-Il to follow the husband and to make sure he doesn\'t do anything rash. The husband eventually confronts Kang-Il and assaults him. Later, Mi-Soo learns of the incident between firefighter Kang-Il and the husband. She concocts a plan to cozy up to the firefighter, in hopes of enlisting him in her legal defense. Little does she know, she isn\'t dealing with an ordinary fellow and she just may have found her true love.

BLACK SWAN follows the story of Nina (Portman), a ballerina in a New York City ballet company whose life, like all those in her profession, is completely consumed with dance. She lives with her retired ballerina mother Erica (Barbara Hershey) who zealously supports her daughter,s professional ambition. When artistic director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder) for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily (Kunis), who impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side with a recklessness that threatens to destroy her. -- (C) Official

John\'s father walked out on the family when he was four years old, and the boy was given to Mimi to raise, even though his mother, Julia (Anne-Marie Duff), was still alive. While Mimi\'s straight-laced nature runs counter to John\'s more reckless personality, they clearly love one another and the household is thrown into chaos when George dies suddenly. At the funeral, teenage John (now played by Aaron Johnson) sees Julia, and learns to his surprise that she lives only a few blocks away from Mimi. John pays her a visit, and Julia gratefully welcomes him back into her life. Julia\'s personality is a much closer fit to John than Mimi, and she encourages his love for writing and music, teaching him to play the banjo. However, John\'s renewed relationship with Julia brings up a number of unanswered questions, and causes new tensions between Mimi and John. And as rock & roll becomes the hot new sound of the day, John falls in love with the bold new music and makes a friend who is interested in forming a band, Paul (Thomas Brodie Sangster).

After escaping the Japanese occupation of his hometown of Fo Shan, China, Ip Man and his family have arrived in Hong Kong, which is living under the iron fist of British colonial rule. Ip wants to support his family by opening up a martial arts academy to teach his unique Wing Chun style. But a corrupt cabal of Hong Kong martial arts masters, led by Hung Chun-nam (the legendary Sammo Hung), refuses to allow Ip to teach until he proves himself - and prove himself he does, in an intense series of fights against the masters showcasing a dazzling variety of martial arts styles, culminating in a highly anticipated brawl between Ip and Hung atop a rickety table. But even after gaining the respect of the masters, Ip\'s troubles are far from over. Hong Kong under British rule is a world of corruption, and when a Western-style boxer named Taylor \"Twister\" Milos comes to town to entertain the British upper-class, and insults both Chinese martial arts and the native citizens in a horrifically violent way, Ip must step up and fight for the honor of both his kung fu and the Chinese people. Forced by honor to enter a brutal \"King of the Ring\" boxing match against Twister, it\'s East versus West in an amazing, knock-down drag-out fight to the finish, the likes of which have never been seen on-screen before.

Inspired by true events that are too over-the-top for even the wildest imaginations to conjure, CASINO JACK lays bare the wild excesses and escapades of Jack Abramoff.

When the two enlist a mob-connected buddy (Jon Lovitz) to help with one of their illegal schemes, they soon find themselves in over their heads, entrenched in a world of mafia assassins, murder and a scandal that spins so out of control that it makes worldwide headlines. Directed by George Hickenlooper (FACTORY GIRL, THE MAN FROM ELYSIAN FIELDS), CASINO JACK returns Spacey to the type of role that made him famous - a cool-headed, articulate snake charmer whose wild ambitions knows no limits or boundaries.

A cat belonging to a widowed rabbi and his beautiful daughter, Zlabya, eats the family parrot and miraculously gains the ability to speak.

Rich with the colors, textures, flavors and music of Mediterranean Africa, the film embarks on a cross continent adventure from the tiled terraces, fountains, quays and cafes of colonial Algiers to Maghrebi tent camps, dusty trading outposts, and deep blue Saharan nights in search of a lost Ethiopian city.

He gets his wakeup call early one morning when he becomes an unwitting participant in an ill-conceived bank heist. Rather than give up the names of the real culprits, Henry takes the fall and goes to jail. There, he meets the irrepressible Max (JAMES CAAN), a con man who\'s grown far too comfortable with the familiarity and security of his \'idyllic\' life behind bars, but one who also helps plant an idea in Henry\'s mind which will change his life forever: for a man to find his purpose, he must first have a dream. Upon his release one year later, Henry finds his purpose. Having done the time, he decides he may as well do the crime. Discovering a long forgotten bootlegger\'s tunnel which runs from the very same bank to a theater across the alleyway, he convinces the reluctant Max to file for his long overdue parole -- and then recruits his former cellmate to help stage a robbery. Their plan is simple: by infiltrating the theater and its current production of Chekhov\'s, The Cherry Orchard, the unlikely duo will buy just enough time to dig their way to the adjacent bank vault and drive off with their loot. Unfortunately that plan also includes Henry taking the lead role in the play, where he finds himself slowly falling for the production\'s mercurial leading lady, Julie (VERA FARMIGA). By turns wry, off-beat, and simply hilarious, HENRY\'S CRIME is the heartwarming story of a man who finds his purpose in life.

Over the years, martial arts legends such as Bruce Lee (FIST OF FURY) and Jet Li (FIST OF LEGEND) have played the popular hero. In LEGEND OF THE FIST: THE RETURN OF CHEN ZHEN, Donnie Yen continues this rich historical legacy, but with a brand new take on the urban legend. In 1920s China, the nation is divided by infighting. Japan has become the most powerful force in Asia, taking over Northern Shanghai. With the city torn in half by international conflict, the popular nightclub \"Casablanca\" has become a hotbed of spies, mobsters, English officials and the Japanese military- all looking to gain control of the country, with little regard for what happens to its citizens. Into this den of intrigue enters Chen Zhen (Donnie Yen), who has returned to China after fighting alongside the Allied forces in Europe, bringing some dark secrets from his past along with him. During the day, he\'s known as \"Ku\", and appears to be just another wealthy playboy. But at night, he takes to the street as a masked warrior, determined to subvert the Japanese invasion while becoming entangled with the sultry Kiki (Played by Shu Qi), who has a dangerous secret of her own. When his past catches up to him, Zhen is faced with near impossible odds- but his skills are formidable, and he\'s up to the challenge. Combining the best of today\'s martial arts and superhero action with the classic spy thrillers of the past (and a healthy dollop of film noir on top), LEGEND OF THE FIST is the rare action film that truly gives the audience something they\'ve never seen before. --(c) Variance',NULL,'http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/15/62/11156246_mob.jpg'),(1170,'Chaos Theory',2007,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/chaos_theory/','770679810','0460745',2,NULL,'Ryan Reynolds and Emily Mortimer do what they can, but ultimately Chaos Theory is an overly conventional dramedy.','http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/46/11164647_mob.jpg'),(1171,'The Contender',2000,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1100998-contender/','16856','0208874',2,NULL,'Critics say this political thriller is solidly made, with top-notch performances, screenplay, and direction for about two third of the film.

The picture opens in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in late 1988, when military trainees Petrovsky, Ryaba, Chugun, Stas, Pinochet, Lyutev and Vorobyev are whipped into shape at a training camp by the brutal, sadistic commander, Warrant Officer Dygalo - prior to being sent off to the front lines. After several one-by-one dalliances with the local whore, Snow White, and a cautionary lecture on the history, geography and culture of Afghanistan (which most of the men sleep through), the trainees head off to battle - first to the Bagram air base, then to the Afghani province of Khost to secure supply lines. But nothing can begin to prepare them for the brutal devastation into which they are plunged, or the relentless tide of slaughter that scatters thousands of Soviet victims in its wake. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi',NULL,'http://content7.flixster.com/movie/53/33/14/5333141_mob.jpg'),(1180,'Cat People',1942,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1003757-cat_people/','185962182','0034587',2,NULL,'Influential noir director Jacques Tourneau infused this sexy, moody horror film with some sly commentary about the psychology and the taboos of desire.','http://content8.flixster.com/movie/20/86/15/2086154_mob.jpg'),(1181,'The Curse of the Jade Scorpion',2001,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/curse_of_the_jade_scorpion/','11829','0256524',2,NULL,'The writing for Scorpion is not as sharp as Woody Allen\'s previous movies as most of the jokes fall flat.','http://content6.flixster.com/movie/26/26/262600_mob.jpg'),(1182,'The Central Park Five',2012,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_central_park_five_2012/','771307293','2380247',2,'In 1989, five black and Latino teenagers were arrested and charged for brutally attacking and raping a white female jogger in Central Park.

Ever since Gru was a little boy, he dreamed of going to the moon. Now, if Gru can just build a rocket and get his hands on a powerful shrink-ray, he can cement his reputation as the greatest thief who ever lived by stealing the Earth\'s satellite right out of the sky. But immediately after Gru heists the shrink-ray, the cunning super-nerd Vector (Jason Segel) swoops in and snatches it right out of his hands. Now, in order to claim the moon, Gru must first reacquire the weapon from Vector. Armed with the knowledge that his nemesis has a mean sweet tooth, Gru adopts cookie-selling orphans Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Agnes (Elsie Fisher), and Edith (Dana Gaier) and commissions a new line of cookie robots from the evil Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand), his personal weapons specialist. But as Gru and his diminutive yellow minions prepare to carry out the biggest heist in history, something strange happens. Gru discovers that the three little girls who have come into his life are much more than simple pawns. They actually seem to care about Gru, and it turns out the scheming evildoer makes a pretty good father. When Gru realizes that his upcoming moon mission clashes with a ballet performance by the girls, he must decide what\'s more important -- being a present parent or cementing his nefarious reputation once and for all. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi','Borrowing heavily (and intelligently) from Pixar and Looney Tunes, Despicable Me is a surprisingly thoughtful, family-friendly treat with a few surprises of its own.','http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/88/11168864_mob.jpg'),(1355,'Duplicity',2009,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/duplicity_2009/','770683997','1135487',2,NULL,'Duplicity is well-crafted, smart, and often funny, but it\'s mostly more cerebral than visceral and features far too many plot twists.','http://content7.flixster.com/movie/10/88/94/10889485_mob.jpg'),(1356,'How to Train Your Dragon',2010,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1194522-how_to_train_your_dragon/','770782733','0892769',2,'The son of a Viking chief must capture a dragon in order to mark his passage into manhood and prove his worthiness to the tribe in directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois\' adaptation of Cressida Cowell\'s popular children\'s book.

Jackie Chan stars as Bob Ho, an international spy on loan to the CIA who gives up his job in hopes of leading a so-called normal life with his next-door-neighbor girlfriend and her rambunctious brood. There\'s nothing in Spy that the audience hasn\'t seen before from similarly themed incarnations (think The Pacifier), but, fans will appreciate director Brian Levant\'s homage to Jackie Chan\'s past Hong Kong movie blockbusters -- most notably, Police Story and The Legend of Drunken Master -- during the opening credit sequence, which is fitting considering many of the action sequences are derivative of those films.The main story centers on Bob\'s relationship with artsy single mom Gillian (Amber Valletta) and her three kids: precocious teenage stepdaughter Farren (Madeline Carroll), nerdy middle child Ian (Will Shadley), and adorably energetic Nora (Alina Foley). After an emergency sends Gillian away to Denver, Bob steps up and offers to watch the kids while she\'s gone. Ill-equipped to handle a situation that\'s clearly over his head, Bob utilizes his spy skills and gadgets -- video watch, GPS tracking, x-ray glasses -- to gain control over the situation in hopes of winning over the kid\'s affection, but when an old enemy escapes from prison and threatens his potential family, Bob must return to his 007 world of international espionage to protect them.Admittedly, there\'s a certain level of cheese in this film, especially when it comes to the Boris-and-Natasha-style villains, Poldark (Magnus Scheving) and Creel (Katherine Boecher), whose silly Russian stereotyped performances and running joke about American fashion unabashedly border on cringe-worthy territory. Not to mention, the thinly plotted storyline involving brainiac Ian, who accidentally downloads a top-secret formula for oil-eating ooze created by the bad guys, which propels the main action of the film. Adding to the pile are the supporting cast members: George Lopez as the traitorous CIA agent, Glaze, and Billy Ray Cyrus as CIA agent and Bob\'s BFF Colton James, who lends folksy witticisms like \"As gone as rum cake at an AA meeting.\"Even so, Chan\'s charm wins out in the end, and The Spy Next Door\'s most effective sequences involve Bob\'s attempts to bond with the kids -- from taking little Nora shopping for a Halloween costume to helping Ian with school bullies and girls. These comedic moments more or less overshadow an otherwise simplistic narrative, and the audience can\'t help but smile to themselves every time Chan appears onscreen. Die-hard fans might miss the era of classic kick-ass Hong Kong action films, but Spy manages to fill that void as an entertaining alternative that kids and parents alike will enjoy. ~ Alaina O\'Connor, Rovi','Lacking a script funny enough to cover up for Jackie Chan\'s fading physical gifts, The Spy Next Door fails on every conceivable level.','http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/92/77/10927764_mob.jpg'),(1428,'Drive',2011,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/drive_2011/','771224338','0780504',2,'Ryan Gosling stars as a Los Angeles wheelman for hire, stunt driving for movie productions by day and steering getaway vehicles for armed heists by night.

Tamara Drewe was adapted from the graphic novel of the same name by Posy Simmonds, which was in turn inspired by Thomas Hardy\'s novel Far From the Madding Crowd. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi',NULL,'http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/15/11151513_mob.jpg'),(1637,'Why Did I Get Married?',2007,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/why_did_i_get_married/','770674785','0840040',2,NULL,'Despite some poignant observations on modern marriages, Why Did I Get Married? is too preachy and melodramatic.','http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/12/21/11122110_mob.jpg'),(1638,'Russian Dolls (Les Poupees Russes)',2005,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/russian_dolls/','155654921','0409184',2,NULL,'Like its predecessor L\'Auberge Espagnole, Russian Dolls is charmingly breezy and light.','http://content6.flixster.com/movie/27/23/02/2723024_mob.jpg'),(1639,'Dear Frankie',2004,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dear_frankie/','10092','0377752',2,NULL,'Dear Frankie is a small, good-hearted film with fine performances.','http://content8.flixster.com/movie/10/91/90/10919002_mob.jpg'),(1640,'Detention',2012,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/detention_2011/','771236596','1701990',2,'An apocalyptic fantasy, horror, science fiction, action- thriller, body swapping, time-traveling teen romantic comedy starring Josh Hutcherson, Dane Cook and Shanley Caswell, Detention follows the local students of Grizzly Lake as they survive their final year of high school.

So much so than when her best friend, Rhiannon (Aly Michalka), asks Olive how her weekend went, the bored teen decides to whip up a spicy white lie just to make things interesting. But that minor exaggeration begins to take on a life of its own when it reaches the ears of motor-mouth gossip Jesus freak Marianne (Amanda Bynes), and in no time the entire student body is abuzz over unassuming Olive\'s unrepentant weekend of debauchery. Of course not a word of it is true, but that doesn\'t stop everyone in school from talking, and an amused Olive from deciding to go with the flow. Playing the role of the hussy to the hilt, the girl who used to be invisible begins dressing provocatively and turning heads in the hallways. The students aren\'t the only ones taking notice, either; Olive\'s English teacher, Mr. Griffith (Thomas Haden Church), is concerned that the kind of attention she\'s receiving isn\'t healthy for a developing girl, and his wife (Lisa Kudrow), the school guidance counselor, is in full agreement. The only people who seem remotely interested in the truth are Olive\'s trusting and open-minded parents (Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson). As Olive takes note of the parallels between her own situation and the plight of the Scarlet Letter heroine Hester Prynne, she realizes that she may be able to manipulate her newfound notoriety to give fellow classmate Brandon\'s (Dan Byrd) popularity a much-needed shot in the arm.

Jeremy Brock has adapted the scr eenplay from Rosemary Sutcliff\'s classic novel The Eagle of the Ninth. In 140 AD, the Roman Empire extends all the way to Britain - though its grasp is incomplete, as the rebellious tribes of Caledonia (today\'s Scotland) hold sway in the far North. Marcus Aquila (Channing Tatum) arrives in Britain, determined to restore the tarnished reputation of his father, Flavius Aquila. It was 20 years earlier that Rome\'s 5,000-strong Ninth Legion, under the command of Flavius and carrying their golden emblem, the Eagle of the Ninth, marched north into Caledonia. They never returned; Legion and Eagle simply vanished into the mists. Angered, the Roman Emperor Hadrian ordered the building of a wall to seal off the territory; Hadrian\'s Wall became the northernmost frontier of the Roman Empire - the edge of the known world. Driven to become a brilliant soldier and now given command of a small fort in the southwest, Marcus bravely leads his troops during a siege. Commended by Rome for his bravery, yet discharged from the army because of his severe wounds, Marcus convalesces, demoralized, in the villa of his Uncle Aquila (Donald Sutherland), a retired army man. When Marcus impulsively gets a young Briton\'s life spared at a gladiatorial contest, Aquila buys the Briton, Esca (Jamie Bell), to be Marcus\' slave. Marcus is dismissive of Esca, who harbors a seething hatred of all things Roman. Yet Esca vows to serve the man who has saved his life. Hearing a rumor that the Eagle has been seen in a tribal temple in the far north, Marcus is galvanized into action, and sets off with Esca across Hadrian\'s Wall. But the highlands of Caledonia are a vast and savage wilderness, and Marcus must rely on his slave to navigate the region. When they encounter ex-Roman soldier Guern (Mark Strong), Marcus realizes that the mystery of his father\'s disappearance may well be linked to the secret of his own slave\'s identity and loyalty - a secret all the more pressing when the two come face-to-face with the warriors of the fearsome Seal Prince (Tahar Rahim).

The documentary\'s focus is French-born L.A. thrift-shop owner Thierry Guetta, whose apparent compulsion to videotape every moment of his life led him to document the phenomenon of contemporary street art. Guetta\'s cousin, a street artist known as Space Invader, allowed the avid cameraman to tape him as he illegally spread his artwork, and Space Invader also introduced him to other street artists, whose work Guetta captured on tape. Eventually, Guetta hooked up with Shepard Fairey, who was best known (before he created an iconic Barack Obama campaign poster) for his widespread stickers featuring an image of the late wrestler Andre the Giant over the word \"OBEY.\" Guetta soon hears about the mysterious street artist/prankster Banksy, and becomes obsessed with finding him and videotaping his exploits. Thanks to Guettta\'s growing reputation among street artists, the two eventually meet and form a sort of partnership. Guetta even videotapes Banksy\'s infamous \"Gitmo\" prank at Disneyland, wherein a handcuffed, hooded figure in an orange jumpsuit is placed beside one of the rides. They get along quite well until Banksy suggests that Guetta stop shooting, take the countless hours of footage he\'s accumulated, and start assembling them into a documentary. Banksy eventually takes over the documentary project, and inadvertently pushes Guetta\'s creative energy in a new direction, as Guetta becomes a kind of street artist himself, with shocking results. Exit Through the Gift Shop, narrated by Rhys Ifans, had its world premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. While it was very well received, there was much speculation as to the documentary\'s veracity and the provenance of Guetta, his videotape, and his artwork.

Already unsure of the games his wife is playing, David is both uncomfortable and curious when she brings a sultry Italian girl, Marita (CATERINA MURINO), to spice things up.

Nicknamed \"The Sheriff of Wall Street,\" when he was NY\'s Attorney General, Eliot Spitzer prosecuted crimes by America\'s largest financial institutions and some of the most powerful executives in the country. After his election as Governor, with the largest margin in the state\'s history, many believed Spitzer was on his way to becoming the nation\'s first Jewish President. Then, shockingly, Spitzer\'s meteoric rise turned into a precipitous fall when the New York Times revealed that Spitzer - the paragon of rectitude - had been caught seeing prostitutes. As his powerful enemies gloated, his supporters questioned the timing of it all: as the Sheriff fell, so did the financial markets, in a cataclysm that threatened to unravel the global economy.

It\'s a whimsical fish-out-of-water story of two spoiled sisters: Nora (Camilla Belle), a law student, and Mary (Alexa Vega), an undergrad party girl, living with their father in a luxurious mansion in Beverly Hills. Mary has become so \"90210\" she refuses to admit she is of Mexican descent. When dad suddenly passes away, their posh lives are turned upside down. They discover they have been left penniless and are forced to move into their estranged aunt Aurelia\'s (Adriana Barraza) modest but lively home in the Latino-centric Boyle Heights neighborhood of East LA. They are terrified to leave their world of privilege; neither Nora nor Mary speak Spanish or have ever had to take on actual responsibility. The girls gradually adapt to their new environment; their BMW and Prius are traded for the public bus and a used car. As they embrace the culture that for so long they refused to accept, they both discover romance, the true meaning of family, and they learn that the life of PRADA actually means NADA without love, family and community.

Aura (Lena Dunham) has just graduated from a university in the Midwest, receiving a degree in film theory that even she seems to realize is essentially worthless. With no real prospects she returns home to her mother, Siri (Laurie Simmons), a successful photographer living in New York City. Aura\'s 17-year-old sister, Nadine (Grace Dunham), is about to graduate from high school and is choosing which college to attend in the fall; Aura is ostensibly back home to help Siri and Nadine during a hectic time, but they don\'t appear to particularly need or want her assistance. Aura befriends Jed (Alex Karpovsky), a minor celebrity thanks to his surreal YouTube videos, who insists he\'s in New York to take meetings for an upcoming TV project; he soon invites himself into Aura\'s bedroom as a semi-permanent guest, though he clearly has no interest in any sort of romantic or sexual relationship. With little else to do, Aura takes a job at a nearby restaurant and becomes smitten with Keith (David Call), one of the cooks; while he seems attracted to her, he also has a girlfriend and it isn\'t until they\'re both stoned one night that he makes his move in a rather unusual setting. Tiny Furniture was written and directed by Lena Dunham, who also plays Aura; Laurie Simmons and Grace Dunham are her mother and sister in real life as well as in the film, which was mostly shot in Simmons\' actual apartment.

Omar Metwally stars as Omar Razaghi, a young graduate student in the U.S. who wishes to author a biography on the late Jules Gund -- an enigmatic writer who spent his final years with his family in Uruguay, then committed suicide. Omar writes the Gund clan to request permission to pen the text, but is shocked and baffled by the family\'s refusal to comply. At the urging of Omar\'s forceful girlfriend, Dierdre (Alexandra Maria Lara), Omar books a seat about the next flight to Uruguay, visits the Gund enclave, and tries to persuade them to change their minds. Present are Gund\'s gay twin brother Adam (Anthony Hopkins), his widow Caroline (Laura Linney), his mistress Arden (Charlotte Gainsbourg), and his young daughter by Arden, Portia (Ambar Mallman). Omar works on the family members one by one, but runs into extreme difficulty both with Caroline -- a hateful woman bearing deep-seated resentments, who initially refuses to comply with the project at all costs -- and with Adam, who agrees to participate on the condition that Omar perform a dangerous favor in return. Meanwhile, passions begin to stir between Omar and Arden, and Dierdre decides to pay a visit. Unfortunately, The City of Your Final Destination received severely limited theatrical distribution, and failed to make much of a splash at the box office, despite favorable notices from a number of U.S. critics and Ivory\'s excellent track record. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi','A stellar cast can\'t elevate this leaden adaptation that, while just as beautiful as anything director James Ivory\'s made before, comes off as dusty and dry.','http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/86/11168671_mob.jpg'),(2455,'Fast Food Fast Women',2000,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fast_food_fast_women/','16738','0206742',2,NULL,'Fast Food, Fast Women tries too hard to be kooky and charming.','http://content8.flixster.com/movie/10/91/62/10916258_mob.jpg'),(2456,'Fordson: Faith, Fasting, Football',2011,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fordson_faith_fasting_football/','771238537','1733436',2,'Fordson follows a predominately Arab-American high school football team from Dearborn, Michigan during the last ten days of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and unearths the story of a community desperately holding onto its Islamic faith while struggling to gain acceptance in post 9-11 America. -- (C) Official Site',NULL,'http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/16/04/11160426_mob.jpg'),(2457,'Flirting',1990,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/flirting/','14506','0101898',2,NULL,'A terrific follow-up to The Year My Voice Broke, Flirting is a teen movie worth watching, thanks to emotionally engaging performances and an endearing script.','http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/15/45/11154547_mob.jpg'),(2458,'Fat Kid Rules the World',2012,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fat_kid_rules_the_world/','771249573','1995304',2,'Troy Billings is seventeen, overweight, and suicidal.

Colin Campbell was working to find a way to feed the citizens of impoverished Third World nations when a trip to the Philippines forever changed the way he thought about food consumption. There, he discovered that the rates of liver cancer among affluent children who subsisted on diets rich in animal-based foods were notably higher than in children consuming plant-based diets. Meanwhile, surgeon Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, head of the Breast Cancer Task Force at Cleveland Clinic, was also discovering that many of the diseases he was seeing in patients were practically nonexistent in areas of the world where people were primarily consuming plant foods. Several subsequent investigations by the researchers (who would not meet each other until the 1980s), including a groundbreaking study in China by Dr. Campbell, led them to the revelation that a whole-food, plant-based diet could prevent, and even reverse, such degenerative conditions as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some forms of cancer. In this film, Fulkerson examines Dr. Campbell\'s and Dr. Esselstyn\'s theories by following the two doctors\' individual, yet very similar, story arcs, from their farm-based upbringings to their astounding discoveries. The film also records the experiences of a group of patients suffering from chronic maladies as they participate in an experiment in which their diets are substantially altered and wholesome, plant-based food is, essentially, used as medicine. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi',NULL,'http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/71/11157125_mob.jpg'),(2499,'Gladiator',2000,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gladiator/','13065','0172495',2,NULL,'Ridley Scott and an excellent cast successfully convey the intensity of Roman gladitorial combat as well as the political intrigue brewing beneath.','http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/89/11168944_mob.jpg'),(2500,'Mean Girls',2004,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mean_girls/','10075','0377092',2,NULL,'Funnier and more smartly written than the average teen comedy.','http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/89/11168957_mob.jpg'),(2501,'Austin Powers in Goldmember',2002,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/austin_powers_in_goldmember/','11167','0295178',2,NULL,'While the narrative structure is messy and doesn\'t make much sense, the third installment of the Austin Powers franchise contains enough inspired bits to entertain.','http://content8.flixster.com/movie/16/90/52/1690522_mob.jpg'),(2502,'Gangster Squad',2013,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gangster_squad_2012/','771256131','1321870',2,'Los Angeles, 1949.

The resulting governing body, according to critics, existed in a bubble so far-removed from the grim realities of the Iraq War that it failed to properly assess the needs of the people. In this fictional thriller set during the U.S.-led occupation of Baghdad, director Greengrass and screenwriter Brian Helgeland use Chandrasekaran\'s journalistic account as the foundation for the story of an officer who joins forces with a senior CIA officer to unearth evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller (Matt Damon) is certain that Hussein has been stockpiling WMDs in the Iraqi desert, but in their race from one empty site to the next, they soon stumble across evidence of an elaborate cover up. As a result, Miller realizes that operatives on both sides of the conflict are attempting to spin the story in their favor.

Since then, gas drilling has been sharply on the rise, and when Josh Fox, a theatrical director and filmmaker, was offered $100,000 for the gas rights to family property on the Delaware River Basis in Pennsylvania, he was curious about the possible effects of drilling. Fox set out to talk to other property owners about what he could expect, and their answers startled him -- fracking taints water sources near drilling sites, and many households have discovered their water is not only undrinkable after gas drilling, it\'s even flammable. It turns out this is just the tip of the iceberg of the environmental damage done by reckless gas drilling, and in his documentary Gasland, Fox travels to 34 states and talks to dozens of property owners and environmental experts on the under-reported menace of fracking and the truth about the dangers of natural gas.

But few people know that Seattle had a thriving funk and R&B scene in the 1960s and 70s; while none of them broke through to nationwide success, bands like Cookin\' Bag, Black On White Affair, The Soul Swingers and Cold, Bold & Together were stars in the city\'s African-American community and they headlined the city\'s many nightclubs catering to soul music fans. However, most of those groups had been forgotten for years when in 2001 Mr. Supreme, a Seattle-area hip hop DJ, found a single called \"Bold Soul Sister\" in a bargain bin and gave it a spin. Supreme was impressed with the groove, and surprised to discover it was a local release from a Seattle-based funk act. Supreme began digging up as many Seattle funk and soul rarities as he could find, and eventually helped compile Wheedle\'s Groove, a CD collection featuring rare R&B sides from the Northwest. Supreme started researching the history of Seattle\'s soul scene and helped coordinate a gig in which many of the city\'s classic funk acts reunited for a night. In Wheedle\'s Groove, filmmaker Jennifer Maas examines the legacy of Seattle R&B, interviews some of the leading musicians of the day, includes the thoughts of such notable observers as Quincy Jones, Mark Arm and Ben Gibbard, and includes footage from Supreme\'s reunion concert.
