With Ina May as their leader, the women taught themselves midwifery from the ground up, and, with their families, founded an entirely communal, agricultural society called The Farm. They grew their own food, built their own houses, published their own books, and, as word of their social experiment spread, created a model of care for women and babies that changed a generation\'s approach to childbirth. Forty years ago Ina May led the charge away from isolated hospital birthing rooms, where husbands were not allowed and mandatory forceps deliveries were the norm. Today, as nearly one third of all US babies are born via C-section, she fights to preserve her community\'s hard-won knowledge. With incredible access to the midwives\' archival video collection, the film not only captures the unique sisterhood at The Farm Clinic-from its heyday into the present-but shows childbirth the way most people have never seen it-unadorned, unabashed, and awe-inspiring.

BLACK SWAN follows the story of Nina (Portman), a ballerina in a New York City ballet company whose life, like all those in her profession, is completely consumed with dance. She lives with her retired ballerina mother Erica (Barbara Hershey) who zealously supports her daughter,s professional ambition. When artistic director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder) for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily (Kunis), who impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side with a recklessness that threatens to destroy her. -- (C) Official

John\'s father walked out on the family when he was four years old, and the boy was given to Mimi to raise, even though his mother, Julia (Anne-Marie Duff), was still alive. While Mimi\'s straight-laced nature runs counter to John\'s more reckless personality, they clearly love one another and the household is thrown into chaos when George dies suddenly. At the funeral, teenage John (now played by Aaron Johnson) sees Julia, and learns to his surprise that she lives only a few blocks away from Mimi. John pays her a visit, and Julia gratefully welcomes him back into her life. Julia\'s personality is a much closer fit to John than Mimi, and she encourages his love for writing and music, teaching him to play the banjo. However, John\'s renewed relationship with Julia brings up a number of unanswered questions, and causes new tensions between Mimi and John. And as rock & roll becomes the hot new sound of the day, John falls in love with the bold new music and makes a friend who is interested in forming a band, Paul (Thomas Brodie Sangster).

After escaping the Japanese occupation of his hometown of Fo Shan, China, Ip Man and his family have arrived in Hong Kong, which is living under the iron fist of British colonial rule. Ip wants to support his family by opening up a martial arts academy to teach his unique Wing Chun style. But a corrupt cabal of Hong Kong martial arts masters, led by Hung Chun-nam (the legendary Sammo Hung), refuses to allow Ip to teach until he proves himself - and prove himself he does, in an intense series of fights against the masters showcasing a dazzling variety of martial arts styles, culminating in a highly anticipated brawl between Ip and Hung atop a rickety table. But even after gaining the respect of the masters, Ip\'s troubles are far from over. Hong Kong under British rule is a world of corruption, and when a Western-style boxer named Taylor \"Twister\" Milos comes to town to entertain the British upper-class, and insults both Chinese martial arts and the native citizens in a horrifically violent way, Ip must step up and fight for the honor of both his kung fu and the Chinese people. Forced by honor to enter a brutal \"King of the Ring\" boxing match against Twister, it\'s East versus West in an amazing, knock-down drag-out fight to the finish, the likes of which have never been seen on-screen before.

Inspired by true events that are too over-the-top for even the wildest imaginations to conjure, CASINO JACK lays bare the wild excesses and escapades of Jack Abramoff.

When the two enlist a mob-connected buddy (Jon Lovitz) to help with one of their illegal schemes, they soon find themselves in over their heads, entrenched in a world of mafia assassins, murder and a scandal that spins so out of control that it makes worldwide headlines. Directed by George Hickenlooper (FACTORY GIRL, THE MAN FROM ELYSIAN FIELDS), CASINO JACK returns Spacey to the type of role that made him famous - a cool-headed, articulate snake charmer whose wild ambitions knows no limits or boundaries.

He gets his wakeup call early one morning when he becomes an unwitting participant in an ill-conceived bank heist. Rather than give up the names of the real culprits, Henry takes the fall and goes to jail. There, he meets the irrepressible Max (JAMES CAAN), a con man who\'s grown far too comfortable with the familiarity and security of his \'idyllic\' life behind bars, but one who also helps plant an idea in Henry\'s mind which will change his life forever: for a man to find his purpose, he must first have a dream. Upon his release one year later, Henry finds his purpose. Having done the time, he decides he may as well do the crime. Discovering a long forgotten bootlegger\'s tunnel which runs from the very same bank to a theater across the alleyway, he convinces the reluctant Max to file for his long overdue parole -- and then recruits his former cellmate to help stage a robbery. Their plan is simple: by infiltrating the theater and its current production of Chekhov\'s, The Cherry Orchard, the unlikely duo will buy just enough time to dig their way to the adjacent bank vault and drive off with their loot. Unfortunately that plan also includes Henry taking the lead role in the play, where he finds himself slowly falling for the production\'s mercurial leading lady, Julie (VERA FARMIGA). By turns wry, off-beat, and simply hilarious, HENRY\'S CRIME is the heartwarming story of a man who finds his purpose in life.

Over the years, martial arts legends such as Bruce Lee (FIST OF FURY) and Jet Li (FIST OF LEGEND) have played the popular hero. In LEGEND OF THE FIST: THE RETURN OF CHEN ZHEN, Donnie Yen continues this rich historical legacy, but with a brand new take on the urban legend. In 1920s China, the nation is divided by infighting. Japan has become the most powerful force in Asia, taking over Northern Shanghai. With the city torn in half by international conflict, the popular nightclub \"Casablanca\" has become a hotbed of spies, mobsters, English officials and the Japanese military- all looking to gain control of the country, with little regard for what happens to its citizens. Into this den of intrigue enters Chen Zhen (Donnie Yen), who has returned to China after fighting alongside the Allied forces in Europe, bringing some dark secrets from his past along with him. During the day, he\'s known as \"Ku\", and appears to be just another wealthy playboy. But at night, he takes to the street as a masked warrior, determined to subvert the Japanese invasion while becoming entangled with the sultry Kiki (Played by Shu Qi), who has a dangerous secret of her own. When his past catches up to him, Zhen is faced with near impossible odds- but his skills are formidable, and he\'s up to the challenge. Combining the best of today\'s martial arts and superhero action with the classic spy thrillers of the past (and a healthy dollop of film noir on top), LEGEND OF THE FIST is the rare action film that truly gives the audience something they\'ve never seen before. --(c) Variance',NULL,'http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/15/62/11156246_mob.jpg'),(1170,'Chaos Theory',2007,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/chaos_theory/','770679810','0460745',1,NULL,'Ryan Reynolds and Emily Mortimer do what they can, but ultimately Chaos Theory is an overly conventional dramedy.','http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/46/11164647_mob.jpg'),(1171,'The Contender',2000,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1100998-contender/','16856','0208874',1,NULL,'Critics say this political thriller is solidly made, with top-notch performances, screenplay, and direction for about two third of the film.

The picture opens in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in late 1988, when military trainees Petrovsky, Ryaba, Chugun, Stas, Pinochet, Lyutev and Vorobyev are whipped into shape at a training camp by the brutal, sadistic commander, Warrant Officer Dygalo - prior to being sent off to the front lines. After several one-by-one dalliances with the local whore, Snow White, and a cautionary lecture on the history, geography and culture of Afghanistan (which most of the men sleep through), the trainees head off to battle - first to the Bagram air base, then to the Afghani province of Khost to secure supply lines. But nothing can begin to prepare them for the brutal devastation into which they are plunged, or the relentless tide of slaughter that scatters thousands of Soviet victims in its wake. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi',NULL,'http://content7.flixster.com/movie/53/33/14/5333141_mob.jpg'),(1180,'Cat People',1942,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1003757-cat_people/','185962182','0034587',1,NULL,'Influential noir director Jacques Tourneau infused this sexy, moody horror film with some sly commentary about the psychology and the taboos of desire.','http://content8.flixster.com/movie/20/86/15/2086154_mob.jpg'),(1181,'The Curse of the Jade Scorpion',2001,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/curse_of_the_jade_scorpion/','11829','0256524',1,NULL,'The writing for Scorpion is not as sharp as Woody Allen\'s previous movies as most of the jokes fall flat.','http://content6.flixster.com/movie/26/26/262600_mob.jpg'),(1182,'The Central Park Five',2012,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_central_park_five_2012/','771307293','2380247',1,'In 1989, five black and Latino teenagers were arrested and charged for brutally attacking and raping a white female jogger in Central Park.

Ever since Gru was a little boy, he dreamed of going to the moon. Now, if Gru can just build a rocket and get his hands on a powerful shrink-ray, he can cement his reputation as the greatest thief who ever lived by stealing the Earth\'s satellite right out of the sky. But immediately after Gru heists the shrink-ray, the cunning super-nerd Vector (Jason Segel) swoops in and snatches it right out of his hands. Now, in order to claim the moon, Gru must first reacquire the weapon from Vector. Armed with the knowledge that his nemesis has a mean sweet tooth, Gru adopts cookie-selling orphans Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Agnes (Elsie Fisher), and Edith (Dana Gaier) and commissions a new line of cookie robots from the evil Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand), his personal weapons specialist. But as Gru and his diminutive yellow minions prepare to carry out the biggest heist in history, something strange happens. Gru discovers that the three little girls who have come into his life are much more than simple pawns. They actually seem to care about Gru, and it turns out the scheming evildoer makes a pretty good father. When Gru realizes that his upcoming moon mission clashes with a ballet performance by the girls, he must decide what\'s more important -- being a present parent or cementing his nefarious reputation once and for all. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi','Borrowing heavily (and intelligently) from Pixar and Looney Tunes, Despicable Me is a surprisingly thoughtful, family-friendly treat with a few surprises of its own.','http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/88/11168864_mob.jpg'),(1355,'Duplicity',2009,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/duplicity_2009/','770683997','1135487',1,NULL,'Duplicity is well-crafted, smart, and often funny, but it\'s mostly more cerebral than visceral and features far too many plot twists.','http://content7.flixster.com/movie/10/88/94/10889485_mob.jpg'),(1356,'How to Train Your Dragon',2010,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1194522-how_to_train_your_dragon/','770782733','0892769',1,'The son of a Viking chief must capture a dragon in order to mark his passage into manhood and prove his worthiness to the tribe in directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois\' adaptation of Cressida Cowell\'s popular children\'s book.

Jackie Chan stars as Bob Ho, an international spy on loan to the CIA who gives up his job in hopes of leading a so-called normal life with his next-door-neighbor girlfriend and her rambunctious brood. There\'s nothing in Spy that the audience hasn\'t seen before from similarly themed incarnations (think The Pacifier), but, fans will appreciate director Brian Levant\'s homage to Jackie Chan\'s past Hong Kong movie blockbusters -- most notably, Police Story and The Legend of Drunken Master -- during the opening credit sequence, which is fitting considering many of the action sequences are derivative of those films.The main story centers on Bob\'s relationship with artsy single mom Gillian (Amber Valletta) and her three kids: precocious teenage stepdaughter Farren (Madeline Carroll), nerdy middle child Ian (Will Shadley), and adorably energetic Nora (Alina Foley). After an emergency sends Gillian away to Denver, Bob steps up and offers to watch the kids while she\'s gone. Ill-equipped to handle a situation that\'s clearly over his head, Bob utilizes his spy skills and gadgets -- video watch, GPS tracking, x-ray glasses -- to gain control over the situation in hopes of winning over the kid\'s affection, but when an old enemy escapes from prison and threatens his potential family, Bob must return to his 007 world of international espionage to protect them.Admittedly, there\'s a certain level of cheese in this film, especially when it comes to the Boris-and-Natasha-style villains, Poldark (Magnus Scheving) and Creel (Katherine Boecher), whose silly Russian stereotyped performances and running joke about American fashion unabashedly border on cringe-worthy territory. Not to mention, the thinly plotted storyline involving brainiac Ian, who accidentally downloads a top-secret formula for oil-eating ooze created by the bad guys, which propels the main action of the film. Adding to the pile are the supporting cast members: George Lopez as the traitorous CIA agent, Glaze, and Billy Ray Cyrus as CIA agent and Bob\'s BFF Colton James, who lends folksy witticisms like \"As gone as rum cake at an AA meeting.\"Even so, Chan\'s charm wins out in the end, and The Spy Next Door\'s most effective sequences involve Bob\'s attempts to bond with the kids -- from taking little Nora shopping for a Halloween costume to helping Ian with school bullies and girls. These comedic moments more or less overshadow an otherwise simplistic narrative, and the audience can\'t help but smile to themselves every time Chan appears onscreen. Die-hard fans might miss the era of classic kick-ass Hong Kong action films, but Spy manages to fill that void as an entertaining alternative that kids and parents alike will enjoy. ~ Alaina O\'Connor, Rovi','Lacking a script funny enough to cover up for Jackie Chan\'s fading physical gifts, The Spy Next Door fails on every conceivable level.','http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/92/77/10927764_mob.jpg'),(1428,'Drive',2011,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/drive_2011/','771224338','0780504',1,'Ryan Gosling stars as a Los Angeles wheelman for hire, stunt driving for movie productions by day and steering getaway vehicles for armed heists by night.

Tamara Drewe was adapted from the graphic novel of the same name by Posy Simmonds, which was in turn inspired by Thomas Hardy\'s novel Far From the Madding Crowd. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi',NULL,'http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/15/11151513_mob.jpg'),(1637,'Why Did I Get Married?',2007,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/why_did_i_get_married/','770674785','0840040',1,NULL,'Despite some poignant observations on modern marriages, Why Did I Get Married? is too preachy and melodramatic.','http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/12/21/11122110_mob.jpg'),(1638,'Russian Dolls (Les Poupees Russes)',2005,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/russian_dolls/','155654921','0409184',1,NULL,'Like its predecessor L\'Auberge Espagnole, Russian Dolls is charmingly breezy and light.','http://content6.flixster.com/movie/27/23/02/2723024_mob.jpg'),(1639,'Dear Frankie',2004,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dear_frankie/','10092','0377752',1,NULL,'Dear Frankie is a small, good-hearted film with fine performances.','http://content8.flixster.com/movie/10/91/90/10919002_mob.jpg'),(1640,'Detention',2012,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/detention_2011/','771236596','1701990',1,'An apocalyptic fantasy, horror, science fiction, action- thriller, body swapping, time-traveling teen romantic comedy starring Josh Hutcherson, Dane Cook and Shanley Caswell, Detention follows the local students of Grizzly Lake as they survive their final year of high school.

So much so than when her best friend, Rhiannon (Aly Michalka), asks Olive how her weekend went, the bored teen decides to whip up a spicy white lie just to make things interesting. But that minor exaggeration begins to take on a life of its own when it reaches the ears of motor-mouth gossip Jesus freak Marianne (Amanda Bynes), and in no time the entire student body is abuzz over unassuming Olive\'s unrepentant weekend of debauchery. Of course not a word of it is true, but that doesn\'t stop everyone in school from talking, and an amused Olive from deciding to go with the flow. Playing the role of the hussy to the hilt, the girl who used to be invisible begins dressing provocatively and turning heads in the hallways. The students aren\'t the only ones taking notice, either; Olive\'s English teacher, Mr. Griffith (Thomas Haden Church), is concerned that the kind of attention she\'s receiving isn\'t healthy for a developing girl, and his wife (Lisa Kudrow), the school guidance counselor, is in full agreement. The only people who seem remotely interested in the truth are Olive\'s trusting and open-minded parents (Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson). As Olive takes note of the parallels between her own situation and the plight of the Scarlet Letter heroine Hester Prynne, she realizes that she may be able to manipulate her newfound notoriety to give fellow classmate Brandon\'s (Dan Byrd) popularity a much-needed shot in the arm.

Jeremy Brock has adapted the scr eenplay from Rosemary Sutcliff\'s classic novel The Eagle of the Ninth. In 140 AD, the Roman Empire extends all the way to Britain - though its grasp is incomplete, as the rebellious tribes of Caledonia (today\'s Scotland) hold sway in the far North. Marcus Aquila (Channing Tatum) arrives in Britain, determined to restore the tarnished reputation of his father, Flavius Aquila. It was 20 years earlier that Rome\'s 5,000-strong Ninth Legion, under the command of Flavius and carrying their golden emblem, the Eagle of the Ninth, marched north into Caledonia. They never returned; Legion and Eagle simply vanished into the mists. Angered, the Roman Emperor Hadrian ordered the building of a wall to seal off the territory; Hadrian\'s Wall became the northernmost frontier of the Roman Empire - the edge of the known world. Driven to become a brilliant soldier and now given command of a small fort in the southwest, Marcus bravely leads his troops during a siege. Commended by Rome for his bravery, yet discharged from the army because of his severe wounds, Marcus convalesces, demoralized, in the villa of his Uncle Aquila (Donald Sutherland), a retired army man. When Marcus impulsively gets a young Briton\'s life spared at a gladiatorial contest, Aquila buys the Briton, Esca (Jamie Bell), to be Marcus\' slave. Marcus is dismissive of Esca, who harbors a seething hatred of all things Roman. Yet Esca vows to serve the man who has saved his life. Hearing a rumor that the Eagle has been seen in a tribal temple in the far north, Marcus is galvanized into action, and sets off with Esca across Hadrian\'s Wall. But the highlands of Caledonia are a vast and savage wilderness, and Marcus must rely on his slave to navigate the region. When they encounter ex-Roman soldier Guern (Mark Strong), Marcus realizes that the mystery of his father\'s disappearance may well be linked to the secret of his own slave\'s identity and loyalty - a secret all the more pressing when the two come face-to-face with the warriors of the fearsome Seal Prince (Tahar Rahim).

The documentary\'s focus is French-born L.A. thrift-shop owner Thierry Guetta, whose apparent compulsion to videotape every moment of his life led him to document the phenomenon of contemporary street art. Guetta\'s cousin, a street artist known as Space Invader, allowed the avid cameraman to tape him as he illegally spread his artwork, and Space Invader also introduced him to other street artists, whose work Guetta captured on tape. Eventually, Guetta hooked up with Shepard Fairey, who was best known (before he created an iconic Barack Obama campaign poster) for his widespread stickers featuring an image of the late wrestler Andre the Giant over the word \"OBEY.\" Guetta soon hears about the mysterious street artist/prankster Banksy, and becomes obsessed with finding him and videotaping his exploits. Thanks to Guettta\'s growing reputation among street artists, the two eventually meet and form a sort of partnership. Guetta even videotapes Banksy\'s infamous \"Gitmo\" prank at Disneyland, wherein a handcuffed, hooded figure in an orange jumpsuit is placed beside one of the rides. They get along quite well until Banksy suggests that Guetta stop shooting, take the countless hours of footage he\'s accumulated, and start assembling them into a documentary. Banksy eventually takes over the documentary project, and inadvertently pushes Guetta\'s creative energy in a new direction, as Guetta becomes a kind of street artist himself, with shocking results. Exit Through the Gift Shop, narrated by Rhys Ifans, had its world premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. While it was very well received, there was much speculation as to the documentary\'s veracity and the provenance of Guetta, his videotape, and his artwork.

Catherine soon becomes restless and starts to test her husband\'s devotion, pushing him to the limits of her imagination. Already unsure of the games his wife is playing, David is both uncomfortable and curious when she brings a sultry Italian girl, Marita (CATERINA MURINO), to spice things up.

After his election as Governor, with the largest margin in the state\'s history, many believed Spitzer was on his way to becoming the nation\'s first Jewish President. Then, shockingly, Spitzer\'s meteoric rise turned into a precipitous fall when the New York Times revealed that Spitzer - the paragon of rectitude - had been caught seeing prostitutes. As his powerful enemies gloated, his supporters questioned the timing of it all: as the Sheriff fell, so did the financial markets, in a cataclysm that threatened to unravel the global economy.

It\'s a whimsical fish-out-of-water story of two spoiled sisters: Nora (Camilla Belle), a law student, and Mary (Alexa Vega), an undergrad party girl, living with their father in a luxurious mansion in Beverly Hills. Mary has become so \"90210\" she refuses to admit she is of Mexican descent. When dad suddenly passes away, their posh lives are turned upside down. They discover they have been left penniless and are forced to move into their estranged aunt Aurelia\'s (Adriana Barraza) modest but lively home in the Latino-centric Boyle Heights neighborhood of East LA. They are terrified to leave their world of privilege; neither Nora nor Mary speak Spanish or have ever had to take on actual responsibility. The girls gradually adapt to their new environment; their BMW and Prius are traded for the public bus and a used car. As they embrace the culture that for so long they refused to accept, they both discover romance, the true meaning of family, and they learn that the life of PRADA actually means NADA without love, family and community.

Aura (Lena Dunham) has just graduated from a university in the Midwest, receiving a degree in film theory that even she seems to realize is essentially worthless. With no real prospects she returns home to her mother, Siri (Laurie Simmons), a successful photographer living in New York City. Aura\'s 17-year-old sister, Nadine (Grace Dunham), is about to graduate from high school and is choosing which college to attend in the fall; Aura is ostensibly back home to help Siri and Nadine during a hectic time, but they don\'t appear to particularly need or want her assistance. Aura befriends Jed (Alex Karpovsky), a minor celebrity thanks to his surreal YouTube videos, who insists he\'s in New York to take meetings for an upcoming TV project; he soon invites himself into Aura\'s bedroom as a semi-permanent guest, though he clearly has no interest in any sort of romantic or sexual relationship. With little else to do, Aura takes a job at a nearby restaurant and becomes smitten with Keith (David Call), one of the cooks; while he seems attracted to her, he also has a girlfriend and it isn\'t until they\'re both stoned one night that he makes his move in a rather unusual setting. Tiny Furniture was written and directed by Lena Dunham, who also plays Aura; Laurie Simmons and Grace Dunham are her mother and sister in real life as well as in the film, which was mostly shot in Simmons\' actual apartment.

Omar Metwally stars as Omar Razaghi, a young graduate student in the U.S. who wishes to author a biography on the late Jules Gund -- an enigmatic writer who spent his final years with his family in Uruguay, then committed suicide. Omar writes the Gund clan to request permission to pen the text, but is shocked and baffled by the family\'s refusal to comply. At the urging of Omar\'s forceful girlfriend, Dierdre (Alexandra Maria Lara), Omar books a seat about the next flight to Uruguay, visits the Gund enclave, and tries to persuade them to change their minds. Present are Gund\'s gay twin brother Adam (Anthony Hopkins), his widow Caroline (Laura Linney), his mistress Arden (Charlotte Gainsbourg), and his young daughter by Arden, Portia (Ambar Mallman). Omar works on the family members one by one, but runs into extreme difficulty both with Caroline -- a hateful woman bearing deep-seated resentments, who initially refuses to comply with the project at all costs -- and with Adam, who agrees to participate on the condition that Omar perform a dangerous favor in return. Meanwhile, passions begin to stir between Omar and Arden, and Dierdre decides to pay a visit. Unfortunately, The City of Your Final Destination received severely limited theatrical distribution, and failed to make much of a splash at the box office, despite favorable notices from a number of U.S. critics and Ivory\'s excellent track record. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi','A stellar cast can\'t elevate this leaden adaptation that, while just as beautiful as anything director James Ivory\'s made before, comes off as dusty and dry.','http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/86/11168671_mob.jpg'),(2455,'Fast Food Fast Women',2000,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fast_food_fast_women/','16738','0206742',1,NULL,'Fast Food, Fast Women tries too hard to be kooky and charming.','http://content8.flixster.com/movie/10/91/62/10916258_mob.jpg'),(2456,'Fordson: Faith, Fasting, Football',2011,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fordson_faith_fasting_football/','771238537','1733436',1,'Fordson follows a predominately Arab-American high school football team from Dearborn, Michigan during the last ten days of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and unearths the story of a community desperately holding onto its Islamic faith while struggling to gain acceptance in post 9-11 America. -- (C) Official Site',NULL,'http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/16/04/11160426_mob.jpg'),(2457,'Flirting',1990,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/flirting/','14506','0101898',1,NULL,'A terrific follow-up to The Year My Voice Broke, Flirting is a teen movie worth watching, thanks to emotionally engaging performances and an endearing script.','http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/15/45/11154547_mob.jpg'),(2458,'Fat Kid Rules the World',2012,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fat_kid_rules_the_world/','771249573','1995304',1,'Troy Billings is seventeen, overweight, and suicidal.

Colin Campbell was working to find a way to feed the citizens of impoverished Third World nations when a trip to the Philippines forever changed the way he thought about food consumption. There, he discovered that the rates of liver cancer among affluent children who subsisted on diets rich in animal-based foods were notably higher than in children consuming plant-based diets. Meanwhile, surgeon Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, head of the Breast Cancer Task Force at Cleveland Clinic, was also discovering that many of the diseases he was seeing in patients were practically nonexistent in areas of the world where people were primarily consuming plant foods. Several subsequent investigations by the researchers (who would not meet each other until the 1980s), including a groundbreaking study in China by Dr. Campbell, led them to the revelation that a whole-food, plant-based diet could prevent, and even reverse, such degenerative conditions as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some forms of cancer. In this film, Fulkerson examines Dr. Campbell\'s and Dr. Esselstyn\'s theories by following the two doctors\' individual, yet very similar, story arcs, from their farm-based upbringings to their astounding discoveries. The film also records the experiences of a group of patients suffering from chronic maladies as they participate in an experiment in which their diets are substantially altered and wholesome, plant-based food is, essentially, used as medicine. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi',NULL,'http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/71/11157125_mob.jpg'),(2499,'Gladiator',2000,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gladiator/','13065','0172495',1,NULL,'Ridley Scott and an excellent cast successfully convey the intensity of Roman gladitorial combat as well as the political intrigue brewing beneath.','http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/89/11168944_mob.jpg'),(2500,'Mean Girls',2004,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mean_girls/','10075','0377092',1,NULL,'Funnier and more smartly written than the average teen comedy.','http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/89/11168957_mob.jpg'),(2501,'Austin Powers in Goldmember',2002,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/austin_powers_in_goldmember/','11167','0295178',1,NULL,'While the narrative structure is messy and doesn\'t make much sense, the third installment of the Austin Powers franchise contains enough inspired bits to entertain.','http://content8.flixster.com/movie/16/90/52/1690522_mob.jpg'),(2502,'Gangster Squad',2013,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gangster_squad_2012/','771256131','1321870',1,'Los Angeles, 1949.

The resulting governing body, according to critics, existed in a bubble so far-removed from the grim realities of the Iraq War that it failed to properly assess the needs of the people. In this fictional thriller set during the U.S.-led occupation of Baghdad, director Greengrass and screenwriter Brian Helgeland use Chandrasekaran\'s journalistic account as the foundation for the story of an officer who joins forces with a senior CIA officer to unearth evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller (Matt Damon) is certain that Hussein has been stockpiling WMDs in the Iraqi desert, but in their race from one empty site to the next, they soon stumble across evidence of an elaborate cover up. As a result, Miller realizes that operatives on both sides of the conflict are attempting to spin the story in their favor.

Since then, gas drilling has been sharply on the rise, and when Josh Fox, a theatrical director and filmmaker, was offered $100,000 for the gas rights to family property on the Delaware River Basis in Pennsylvania, he was curious about the possible effects of drilling. Fox set out to talk to other property owners about what he could expect, and their answers startled him -- fracking taints water sources near drilling sites, and many households have discovered their water is not only undrinkable after gas drilling, it\'s even flammable. It turns out this is just the tip of the iceberg of the environmental damage done by reckless gas drilling, and in his documentary Gasland, Fox travels to 34 states and talks to dozens of property owners and environmental experts on the under-reported menace of fracking and the truth about the dangers of natural gas.

But few people know that Seattle had a thriving funk and R&B scene in the 1960s and 70s; while none of them broke through to nationwide success, bands like Cookin\' Bag, Black On White Affair, The Soul Swingers and Cold, Bold & Together were stars in the city\'s African-American community and they headlined the city\'s many nightclubs catering to soul music fans. However, most of those groups had been forgotten for years when in 2001 Mr. Supreme, a Seattle-area hip hop DJ, found a single called \"Bold Soul Sister\" in a bargain bin and gave it a spin. Supreme was impressed with the groove, and surprised to discover it was a local release from a Seattle-based funk act. Supreme began digging up as many Seattle funk and soul rarities as he could find, and eventually helped compile Wheedle\'s Groove, a CD collection featuring rare R&B sides from the Northwest. Supreme started researching the history of Seattle\'s soul scene and helped coordinate a gig in which many of the city\'s classic funk acts reunited for a night. In Wheedle\'s Groove, filmmaker Jennifer Maas examines the legacy of Seattle R&B, interviews some of the leading musicians of the day, includes the thoughts of such notable observers as Quincy Jones, Mark Arm and Ben Gibbard, and includes footage from Supreme\'s reunion concert.

But now the world\'s armies have joined forces for a last stand offensive against the alien horde, with no second chances. Lt. Col. Bill Cage is an officer who has never seen a day of combat when he is unceremoniously demoted and then dropped - untrained and ill-equipped - into what amounts to little more than a suicide mission.

Half-assedly embarking upon his first quest, Thadeous joins Fabious to trek across the perilous outlands and free the princess. Joined by Isabel (Natalie Portman)--an elusive warrior with a dangerous agenda of her own--the brothers must vanquish horrific creatures and traitorous knights before they can reach Belladonna.

It is also an auspicious second feature from director Jie Han, whose distinctive voice is already more than clear. The vast and snowy landscapes of northern China form the striking backdrop to the story of Shu - whose name translates to \"tree\" in Mandarin - a clownish mechanic who resides in a small mining village in the province of Jilin. Shu has a reputation as a slacker, a drunk and a danger to himself and others. He blinds himself temporarily while welding. He meets a fetching mute named Xiaomei who works at a massage parlour and decides to marry her, but this too falls apart. Meanwhile, Shu\'s village seems as doomed as he is. The film opens on a van saddled with loudspeakers, which roams the village offering consumer goods as bribes to townsfolk in the hope that they\'ll willingly uproot themselves to make way for modern property developments. As with so many rural places in China, a way of life is vanishing under the wheels of progress. Teased by hallucinations and haunted by tragic events from his past (which we learn of through flashbacks and voice-over), Shu struggles with an ever-loosening grip on reality. Yet when one of his visions manifests as real, his fellow villagers come to regard him as clairvoyant. Can Shu genuinely see into the future? Is he actually just a basket case?

Discovered after the war, the unfinished work, with no soundtrack, Film Forum is proud to present Yael Hersonski\'s A FILM UNFINISHED, having its U.S. theatrical premiere on Wednesday, August 18. Since the end of WWII, one copy of a 60-minute (unfinished) propaganda film, shot by the Nazis in the Warsaw Ghetto in May 1942 (a year prior to the uprising), labeled simply \"Ghetto,\" sat undisturbed in an East German archive. A FILM UNFINISHED presents the entire film, both documentary and fictionalized sequences (e.g. dozens of Jewish patrons at an elegant restaurant; a luxurious funeral cortege). It includes a revealing interview with Willy Wist, the only cinematographer identified with the production (himself caught onscreen in his SS uniform), as well as scenes in which now-elderly former residents of the Warsaw Ghetto, reviewing the footage, occasionally recognize their neighbors, or report upon the filmmakers\' efforts to stage fantasies of affluence and well-being, or of Jews treating their less fortunate compatriots with callous disdain. This is a film of enormous import: it documents conditions under which ghetto residents lived and the efforts (however imperfect) of the perpetrators to recast this reality to suggest an entirely different scenario.

The son of a wealthy businessman, Abramoff became a Republican activist in college, involved in programs to raise funds for GOP candidates and supporting political movements in Angola and South Africa that he believed promoted a free-market ideology. In 2001, Abramoff took control of a profitable gaming empire after the murder of casino owner Gus Boulis, while also operating a lobbying business that curried political favor among Republican politicians through money and expensive gifts (one of his leading allies was GOP party whip Tom DeLay). However, when Abramoff was discovered to have defrauded a number of Native American groups hoping to open gambling casinos with promises of political favors that could be obtained for the right price, his empire came crashing to the ground, taking a number of important reputations along with it. Filmmaker Alex Gibney chronicles the rise and fall of Jack Abramoff and the often bizarre story of how his political and financial ambitions took root in the documentary Casino Jack and the United States of Money, which includes interviews with a number of his associates and rare newsreel footage of his early years as a political gadfly.

Winner of numerous awards, including Best Feature Documentary at New York\'s NewFest 2010 and the Cadillac People\'s Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival 2009 \'The Topp Twins: Untouchable Girls\' tells the story of the world\'s only comedic, singing, yodeling lesbian twin sisters, Lynda and Jools Topp, whose political activism and unique brand of entertainment has helped change New Zealand\'s social landscape. In the process they have become well-loved cultural icons. The film will open in New York at Cinema Village on May 13. Other cities will follow. This is the first time that the irrepressible Kiwi entertainment double act, Jools and Lynda Topp\'s extraordinary personal story has been told. As well as rarely seen archive footage and home movies, the film features a series of special interviews with some of the Topp\'s infamous comedy alter-egos including candid chats with the two Kens, Camp Mother and Camp Leader, the Bowling Ladies and the Posh Socialite sisters, Prue and Dilly. The Topp Twins have attained a unique status within New Zealand culture, and their fans range from hard core political activists, to sheep farmers and \'Ladies who Lunch\'. Their ability to relate to all kinds of people, and their natural gift for humour, has helped them cross from the fringes to the mainstream. It has often been said that if the story of the Twins was fictional nobody would believe it. From rural backwaters to busking on the streets of Auckland, to performances at the Rugby World Cup and London\'s West End stage, their appeal is infectious. From support act to Split Enz, Billy Bragg, and Midnight Oil to headlining their own hugely successful tours in Australia, Canada, the USA and Britain. The twins have morphed from radical activists into Kiwi \'national treasures\', \'cultural ambassadors\', and finally, according to the Glasgow Herald, into New Zealand\'s \'finest artistic export since lamb cutlets!\' \'The Topp Twins: Untouchable Girls\' follows the girls from their happy childhood on a Waikato dairy farm - where they grew up singing to the cows - to the Territorial Army where they quickly became the Vera Lynns of their battalion. They came of age performing on the streets of Auckland during the heady days of the political protest marches in the early 80s, and quickly joined the forefront of progressive social change campaigning for a Nuclear-Free NZ, Maori Land Rights, a halt to the1981 Springbok Tour, and Homosexual Law Reform. By 1998 only a decade later, Lynda Topp, as Camp Mother, came close to winning the mayoral elections in Auckland, and the Topp Twins were firmly entrenched in the bosom of Kiwi culture with their own prime time TV Series \'Do Not Adjust Your Twinset\'. \'The Topp Twins: Untouchable Girls\' is not just the story of two sisters but also of 50 years of New Zealand history. Half a century of cultural changes and the foundation of a national identity. Part concert film, part biopic, part historical record, part comedy, the Twins share their journey from \"coming out&#8223; to Jools\' recent brush with Breast Cancer with much laughter, honesty and wisdom. It is a film about two truly unique New Zealanders, which ends up saying as much about us as it does about them. \'The Topp Twins: Untouchable Girls\' is directed by award-winning ex BBC documentary filmmaker, Leanne Pooley. Director of Photography role was shared by Leon Narbey (\'Whale Rider\'); one of New Zealand\'s most acclaimed cinematographers, and Wayne Vinten, (Best Cinematography NZ Screen Awards 2008). The film was produced by Arani Cuthbert of Diva Productions, who has also managed the twins for much of their career and produced their popular TV series. -- (C) Argot',NULL,'http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/15/67/11156727_mob.jpg'),(3294,'Untitled Tomorrowland Project',2013,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/untitled_tomorrowland_project/','771186951','1294795',1,'Dwayne Johnson stars in this action adventure set in space from Disney with this Jon Lucas and Scott Moore-scripted picture said to be inspired by the studio\'s Tomorrowland section in their theme parks. ~ Jeremy Wheeler, Rovi',NULL,'http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif'),(3295,'Union Square',2012,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/union_square_2012/','771253877','1783798',1,'An unexpected reunion between estranged sisters, one is on the verge of marriage; the other is on the verge of a nervous breakdown.

The media said it was a natural disaster primarily affecting poor black people. On both counts, the media was wrong. In his feature-length documentary The Big Uneasy, humorist and New Orleans resident Harry Shearer gets the inside story of a disaster that could have been prevented from the people who were there. As we approach the fifth anniversary of the flooding of New Orleans, Shearer speaks to the investigators who poked through the muck as the water receded and a whistle-blower from the Army Corps of Engineers, revealing that some of the same flawed methods responsible for the levee failure during Katrina are being used to rebuild the system expected to protect the new New Orleans from future peril. In short segments hosted by John Goodman, Shearer speaks candidly with local residents about life in New Orleans. Together, they explore the questions that Americans outside of the Gulf region have been pondering in the five years since Katrina: Why would people choose the live below sea level? Why is it important to rebuild New Orleans? The Big Uneasy is laced with computer imagery that takes you inside the structures that failed so catastrophically, and boasts never-before-seen video of the moments when New Orleans began to flood and the painstaking investigations that followed. The Big Uneasy marks the beginning of the end of five years of ignorance about what happened to one of our nation\'s most treasured cities - and serves as a stark reminder that the same agency that failed to protect New Orleans still exists in other cities across America.

This documentary features Egyptian-American comedian Ahmed Ahmed, in his directorial debut, along with a host of critically acclaimed international stand-up comedians. Presented by Cross Cultural Entertainment and Cross Cultural Productions, Just Like Us exemplifies their goal of reintroducing socially relevant issues to the world in an effort to build cultural bridges in this age of greater tolerance, understanding and acceptance. The film documents four countries in the Middle East, showcasing the cultures of Dubai, Lebanon, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Egypt with sold out crowds totaling over 20,000 people. Contemporary stand-up comedy has the powerful ability to provide relief, encourage a younger generation, break down barriers and serves as a platform for cross cultural dialogue.

Depression and suicide is common among the Guarani, and Osvaldo (Abrisio da Silva Pedro) and Ireneu (Ademilson Concianza Verga) decide its time for them to stand up for their people after finding the bodies of two young Guarani women who took their own lives. With the help of tribal leader Nadio (Ambrosio Vilhalva), they organize a protest and soon a band of Guarani peoples are occupying a farm owned by Moreira (Leonardo Medeiros) and his spouse (Chiara Caselli). Nadio insists that Moreira\'s farm is on land that once belonged to the Guarani tribe and was stolen from them; however, Moreira and his wife are racists unsympathetic to the Indians\' cause, and as the conflict between the farmer and the Guarani becomes more heated, Nadio\'s alcoholism makes him increasingly unstable.

Triumph of the Wall is a film about expectations, about two guys who embark on an eight-week journey and spend the next eight years trying to figure out how to finish what they started...a reminder that sometimes art (and life) is as much about the process of creation as it is about the finished product.

Flash-forward to 2008, and Winnie is dating a proprietary trader named Jake Moore (LaBeouf), who expresses a passion for green energy while working for his mentor Louis Zabel (Frank Langella), of Keller Zabel Investments. Despite heading up one of the most prominent investment firms in the country, Louis Zabel is forced to personally fight for the future of Keller Zabel before the Federal Reserve after the company\'s stock takes a hit due to persistent rumors that it\'s being dragged down by debt. Denied a bailout from the government, Keller Zabel soon falls victim to a hostile takeover lead by powerful investment bank partner Bretton James (Josh Brolin), of Churchill Schwartz. His job on the line and his mentor out of the picture, Jake discovers that Gordon Gekko is out promoting his new book \"Is Greed Good?\" and decides to attend a lecture being given by the author at Fordham University. According to Gekko, greed is now sanctioned by the government, and the U.S. economy is on the verge of collapse as a direct result of leveraged debt and wild conjecture. When Jake goes behind Winnie\'s back to try and repair her relationship with her father, Gekko reveals his compelling theories on the likely reasons for Zabel\'s downfall.

Hopelessly neurotic and unrepentantly narcissistic, he gets no joy out of life except for the time he spends with his best friend Kassie (Jennifer Aniston).

Edoardo Recchi Sr. (Gabriele Ferzetti) is the aging patriarch of a Milanese clan that has amassed a significant fortune over the years through shrewd investments in the textile business. Edoardo Sr. has a beautiful wife, Allegra (Marisa Berenson), and the two have a reliable and dependable son, Tancredi (Pippo Delbono). Years ago, Tancredi met, fell in love with, and then married a woman named Emma (Tilda Swinton) amid a trip to Russia, and brought her back home to Milan; their children include sons Edoardo Jr. (Flavio Parenti) and Gianluca (Mattia Zaccaro), and artist daughter Elisabetta (Alba Rohrwacher). The family gathers for a reunion at Edoardo Sr. and Allegra\'s villa in Milan, but the happy gathering takes a somber turn when Edoardo suddenly dies not long after having lunch with his family. But the death is far from the only pivotal event that occurs that day: Edoardo Jr. also introduces his mother to a chef, Antonio (Edoardo Gabbriellini), with whom he plans to open a restaurant, and Emma finds herself drawn to the culinary artist. Meanwhile, Emma learns that Elisabetta is a lesbian, and though initially startled by this news, she takes the liberation of her daughter as inspiration for her own liberation from confining nuptials. On impulse, Emma travels to San Remo, catches sight of Antonio, and finds herself helplessly drawn to him. Meanwhile, as Emma and Elisabetta undertake their life-changing journeys, all of the men in the Recchi clan outside of Edoardo Jr. feel bound to profit-driven motives -- the commercialism of a class that has long ago shucked responsibility for its workers.

Just eight months ago, they were a happy suburban family with everything they wanted. Now, they are caught in a maze of memory, longing, guilt, recrimination, sarcasm and tightly controlled rage from which they cannot escape. While Becca finds pain in the familiar, Howie finds comfort. <br /><br /> The shifts come in abrupt, unforeseen moments. Becca hesitantly opens up to her opinionated, loving mother (DIANNE WIEST) and secretly reaches out to the teenager involved in the accident that changed everything (MILES TELLER); while Howie lashes out and imagines solace with another woman (SANDRA OH). Yet, as off track as they are, the couple keeps trying to find their way back to a life that still holds the potential for beauty, laughter and happiness. The resulting journey is an intimate glimpse into two people learning to re-engage with each other and a world that has been tilted off its axis. <br /><br /> RABBIT HOLE is directed by John Cameron Mitchell (HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH) from a script by acclaimed playwright David Lindsay-Abaire, adapted from his Pulitzer Prize-winning play.

Because of the sexualinnuendo and the barely-there costumes it has largely been left out of the history books.In the 1840s burlesque was applied to a wide range of comedic plays that entertained the lower and middleclasses in Great Britain. Coming to America, burlesque evolved into shows performed by scantily-cladbeauties. It thrived, appealing to the masses of working class people who weekly stormed the theatres tosee troupes like \"The British Blondes\", a bevy of beauties dressed in tights. Burlesque poked fun at theupper classes, at sex, and at what people were willing to do in the pursuit of obtaining sex. By the 1920sthe old burlesque circuits closed and strip tease was introduced to offer something vaudeville and film didnot.During the Great Depression, for a dime a man could fall into a big gaudy burlesque show and forget histroubles. From theatres to nightclubs, burlesque was a raucous sexy show filled with gorgeous women,strippers, comedians, acrobats and singers. The tame by today\'s standards, the shows were consideredrisque, and most performers were looked down on as second rate.Backed by public outrage, in 1937 New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia closed the burlesque houses in hisstate. The use of the word \"burlesque\" was outlawed in advertising. The Minsky brothers, who some sayintroduced nudity to the burly audiences, were so closely associated with burlesque that La Guardia bannedthe use of the name Minsky. Once again, burlesque changed, moving across the river to New Jersey toescape censure. Eventually comedians and musicians\' parts were reduced in the shows and more stripperswere brought on. By the 1960s hard-core porn was available and burlesque had died. But what happened tothe thousands of performers? Where did they go?\"Behind the Burly Q\" is the behind-the-scenes stories of these men and women as told by the performersthemselves. For the first time ever, the performers from the golden age of burlesque relate theirheartbreaking, triumphant stories of life on the road performing in the burly circuit. Many were ashamed oftheir past and had never talked about their experiences. Just as many had never been asked.Director Leslie Zemeckis and producer Sheri Hellard traveled extensively across the country from theBayous of post-Katrina Mississippi, to New Jersey, Florida and all points between. The duo tracked downand recorded dozens of interviews with little-known performers to the last of the living legends ofburlesque. They spoke with relatives of many deceased stars. The men and women in this documentaryopened their scrapbooks as well as their hearts, relating memories they had all but forgotten.Amongst those interviewed were former musicians, strippers, novelty acts, club owners, funny men andwomen, authors and historians assembled together for the first time ever to tell you just what reallyhappened in a burlesque show. Sadly, many of the performers have since passed away, making this theirlast, and often times only interview. We dedicate this film to their memory.\"Behind the Burly Q\" is the definitive history of burlesque during its heyday.

Those Who Remain looks at how illegal immigration to the United States has impacted Mexico though interviews with people whose family and friends have left Mexico for the dream of a better life in America, and what became of those who stayed on the Southern side of the border. Marisela is a wife and mother whose husband has gone to America, and as she struggles to care for their children on her own, she wonders if she\'ll ever be able to reunite the family in the U.S. Raquel is another wife whose husband crossed into America, but with tragic results -- he lost his life in a violent incident once he settled on the other side. Pascual and Juanita are seniors who have seen three of their children leave Mexico for the United States, leaving them to wonder of they\'ll ever see their loved ones again. Gerardo wants to leave his hometown, which has been hit hard by an economic downturn, but his wife is bitterly opposed to the idea, which is bringing their relationship to the breaking point. And Francisco is a horseman who is happy to explain why he stays in Mexico, even as many of those closest to him have left.

That changes dramatically when Alicia suddenly dies and Leo has to take on the duties of both mother and father. Dafne soon makes it clear that she needs a more nurturing figure in her life and asks for a \"fake mommy.\" Leo\'s efforts to replace Alicia with his former girlfriend Marta (Najwa Nimri) don\'t go well, and one day Dafne asks Leo to dress up as her mother to make her feel better. When the notion seems to work, Leo turns to Alex (Jose Luis Gomez), a veteran comedian with a drag act, for practical advice on how to look and act like a woman, and soon he\'s regularly impersonating Alicia around the house. While this helps Dafne through her rough patch and allows Leo to get in touch with his nurturing side, he finds this hard to explain to others, who deem his behavior strange and even morbid.

In a severe case of irresponsible and reckless teen-age driving, and over the objections of Luke and the other young passengers, the driver lost control of the car at nearly 90 miles-per-hour, spinning off a narrow road and landing in an embankment some seventy feet below. Luke suffered irreparable brain damage, and died in the hospital two days later - just four days before his sixteenth birthday. While in the hospital, the Abbate family made the difficult decision to permit the doctors to utilize Luke\'s organs in a nationwide organ transplant program. Five recipients were almost immediately identified, including a young mother who was suffering with serious heart disease. Sharing an uncommon blood type, Luke\'s heart was flown to the young woman\'s hospital location across the country, resulting in a successful heart transplant, and saving her life. Following his brother\'s death, Jon considered giving up his football career - but knew that doing so would not properly honor the younger brother who loved and idolized him. Upon his return to Wake Forest, Jon was given the approval of head coach Jim Grobe to change his number from his long-standing 40, to his brother\'s number 5. And, in so doing, dedicated the new season to the memory of his brother. The Abbate family founded The Luke Abbate 5th Quarter Foundation for the purposes of educating young people nationwide to the dangers and life-altering consequences of irresponsible driving. A tradition began to evolve during the following Wake Forest games. In paying homage to Luke, Jon would signal his family sitting in the stands (Section 5) by holding up his hand with all 5 fingers outstretched. He did this at the end of the third quarter. Gradually, the rest of his team started to do the same. Within a couple of games, players from both teams, the fans in the stands, and those watching the games on television, would begin the final quarter by raising their hands with all 5 fingers outstretched in honor of Luke\'s memory. The final quarter became known as Luke\'s Quarter, the 5th Quarter, and this humble signal crystallized the entire team. And, although having lost their starting quarterback, starting running back, and starting defensive end to injuries at the beginning of the season, Wake Forest went on to complete their most successful season in school history, winning 11 games against 2 losses. Coach Grobe was selected the ACC\'s Coach-Of-The-Year, and Jon performed brilliantly in the ACC Championship Game with fifteen solo tackles against powerhouse Georgia Tech. -- (c) Official Site',NULL,'http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/63/11156377_mob.jpg'),(4309,'Quarantine 2: Terminal',2011,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/quarantine_2_terminal_2011/','771245039','1699231',1,'A red-eye flight from LAX to Nashville takes a terrifying turn of events when the passengers become infected with a highly contagious virus, and find themselves quarantined in an airport following an emergency landing.

While Shanghai is a city of no small historical importance in China, in Haishang Chuanqi (aka I Wish I Knew) the focus is less on the facts of the city\'s legacy than the stories of the people who have lived there and how their lives have been shaped by its history. Those interviewed by director Zhangke include people whose parents fell victim to the violence during the rise of communism, others who fled the country during the revolution, and those who were witnesses to the Sino-Japanese War and the Cultural Revolution. Zhangke also examines how Shanghai\'s history has been depicted in the Chinese cinema, illustrated by clips from a number of Chinese historical epics, as well as the stories behind some of China\'s great films of the past.

Southeast Oregon, though familiar by name is a foreign place, particularly to those who reside in urban environments. It is a landscape in the making, constantly undergoing change, being re-worked. Through a series of stationary shots, recording open landscapes and activities of local residents, Empty Quarter reflects on the character of the region. Natural areas are viewed among images of industry, various labor processes, resource management and recreation.

Close gal pals Lila (Leila Bekhti) and Ely (Nakache) may technically be \"working class,\" but both hail from pleasant and stable families, in the quiet neighborhood of Puteaux, just outside of the City of Lights. The allure of the Paris elite is too strong for the women to resist, however, and they begin to pick up tips and tricks from a women\'s magazine on how to infiltrate haute society. Each girl carves a unique path for herself: Lila meets wealthy Maxx (Simon Buret) at a bar and attaches herself to him. Ely, on the other hand, takes a job babysitting the son of fashion photographer Agathe (Virginie Ledoyen) and her top model, Joan (Linh-Dan Pham), which means that the young woman gets to spend countless evenings with the child in a gorgeous apartment that boasts a spectacular view of The Eiffel Tower. But the new social circles begin to take their toll, both on a familial level - as when Ely\'s cabbie dad (Daniel Cohen) gets humiliated in front of his daughter\'s new friends - and on a romantic level, as when Lila lies to her Puteaux boyfriend about her real motives.

Runak Faraj, editor of Rewan (Dawn), the center\'s newspaper, and her colleague Kalthum Murad join local Rania Police Chief Abdullah at the crime scene. Chief Abdullah\'s cell phone shows a devastating image of a young woman clad in blue jeans, grabbing her hair in the agony of death. The woman is Nesrin, a young widow. Her mother is dead, and her father lives abroad. Her in-laws took Nesrin\'s children when her husband died, and she lived from house to house after that. \"Why doesn\'t the government fund shelters for homeless women who have no safe place to stay, rather than spend resources investigating their inevitable murders?\" Kalthum asks Rania\'s mayor. womens-media-center Jasmin (pseudonym), a young mother protected at the Asuda Safe House in Sleymaniyah, is shot three times as she prepares for evening prayer. \"If a woman can be shot at a Safe House, what good are these so-called Safe Houses?\" asks Kalthum. Questions such as those posed by Kalthum must be addressed if Kurdish women are to stop honor killing and other toxic traditions. Freelance video journalist Hemin Kaikay and Lawen Asad, a reporter at SOMA, the English language newspaper, investigate the shooting at Asuda. They interview police chiefs, Captain Nariman, head of the KRG\'s newly formed Agency to Prevent Violence Against Women, and even Jasmin\'s jailed brother, who is implicated in the shooting. Through the investigations, interviews and visits to Rewan\'s print house and offices, we learn how the Women\'s Media Center and their investigative reporters vigorously pursue these cases in an effort to get the stories out, educate the public, and change tradition. Kurdish mainstream media follows their lead. Like the problem of honor killing itself, these cases are generally not adequately resolved. The fight for justice and change led by the women and the KRG continues. Kalthum, Runak, and Runak Khan persevere in their work in Kurdistan. They encourage men and women of all backgrounds to join them. BACKSTORY During the Spring 2007 Zhinan shoot, we followed the story of Runak Rauf. I had known of Runak Khan (an honorific term) and admired her strong activist role as a \"watchdog\" of the government of nascent Iraqi Kurdistan. She even criticised policies which involved her son, Barham Salih who presided as Prime Minister of the Sorani speaking part of Kurdistan. Runak Khan added a no nonsense, back to basics voice to the peace movement and shamed men on both sides of the civil crisis to stop all violence. Male Kurdish journalist, Birusk Tugan, who spent ten years with Voice of America, joined us for three months before continuing on to head a Kurdish language video station in Paris. Birusk understood the importance of the work Ruank Faraj and Katlhum were doing and put us onto their investigation of Nasrin\'s murder. He pushed us to follow that case in 120-degree weather peppered by sand storms and with cross-border attacks imminent. Birusk helped direct and conducted many interviews, including the important back and forth at the end of the film with Nasrin\'s brother-in-law. Later, another male Kurdish journalist, Hemin Kaikay, alerted us to the plight of Jasmin and aided our following that case. Lawen Asad, a woman reporter from SOMA, the English language newspaper, joined Hemin in the investigation. -- (C) Official Site',NULL,'http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif'),(4339,'Rabbi Firer: A Reason to Question',2011,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rabbi-firer-a-reason-to-question/','770852512',NULL,1,'Each day, some 150 patients seek an unbiased second opinion from an unusual rabbi, self-educated in medicine.

Her solution: sue her younger brother for libel. Meanwhile, black sheep JOEL (Rainn Wilson), a disaster in slow-motion, plots to turn his life around at his family\'s expense, and MARILYN (Lesley Ann Warren), the children\'s mother, long-divorced from Henry, still carries a torch for her ex, one that\'s only inflamed further by the revelations in PEEP WORLD. For his part, the now-famous Nathan cluelessly wonders what the fuss is all about and basks in his success much to the annoyance of all around him. Over the course of 24 hours, this group of likable and unlikable misfits will summon their courage to come together for the \"family dinner\" they\'ll never forget. -- (C) IFC Films',NULL,'http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/58/11155821_mob.jpg'),(4511,'Presumed Innocent',1990,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/presumed_innocent/','13836','0100404',1,NULL,'Thanks to an outstanding script, focused direction by Alan Pakula, and a riveting performance from Harrison Ford, Presumed Innocent is the kind of effective courtroom thriller most others aspire to be.','http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/79/11167929_mob.jpg'),(4512,'Pretty Persuasion',2005,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pretty_persuasion/','3621','0381505',1,NULL,'Pretty Persuasion aims for high satire but falls short of poignancy by depending on too much black humor, with too little redeeming humanity to provide balance.','http://content8.flixster.com/movie/24/99/249998_mob.jpg'),(4513,'Henry Poole Is Here',2008,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/henry_poole_is_here/','770682052','1029120',1,NULL,'Full of Hallmark-truisms and pop songs presented with strained significance, this comic foible intends less to convert than to preach to the choir.','http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/88/11168861_mob.jpg'),(4514,'Pulse (Kairo)',2001,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1113170-pulse/','9176','0286751',1,NULL,'A sinister spine-tingling techno-thriller whose artistry lies in the power of suggestion rather than a barrage of blood and guts or horror shop special effects.','http://content8.flixster.com/movie/25/05/250502_mob.jpg'),(4515,'Peace, Love, & Misunderstanding',2012,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/peace_love_and_misunderstanding/','771208558','1649780',1,'Directed by two&#8208;time Academy Award nominee Bruce Beresford, Peace, Love, & Misunderstanding stars Academy Award winning Jane Fonda, two&#8208;time Academy Award nominated Catherine Keener, international heartthrob Chace Crawford, and Sundance\'s \"breakout star\" Elizabeth Olsen.

Candid conversations with federal air marshals, airport security agents, and various others who have worked in and around the TSA reveal why the agency is entirely deserving of its reputation for being completely superfluous. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi',NULL,'http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif'),(4555,'Naissance des Pieuvres (Water Lilies)',2007,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/water_lilies/','770683851','0869977',1,NULL,'Water Lilies is a sharply-observed, provocative coming-of-age story that captures the anxieties of the early teen years.','http://content9.flixster.com/movie/10/87/68/10876899_mob.jpg'),(4556,'Play It to the Bone',2000,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/play_it_to_the_bone/','15660','0196857',1,NULL,'Flat characters and uninspired comedy yield forgettable results.','http://content9.flixster.com/movie/28/04/280419_mob.jpg'),(4557,'Little White Lies',2012,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/little_white_lies/','771208137','1440232',1,'French box-office sensation Little White Lies is a sparkling comedic drama from Guillaume Canet, the writer-director of the worldwide smash hit Tell No One.

Catherine Deneuve is Suzanne Pujol, a submissive, housebound \'trophy housewife\' (or \"potiche,\") who steps in to manage the umbrella factory run by her wealthy and tyrannical husband (Fabrice Luchini) after the workers go on strike and take him hostage. To everyone\'s surprise, Suzanne proves herself a competent and assertive woman of action. But when her husband returns from a restful cruise in top form, things get complicated. Gerard Depardieu plays a former union leader and Suzanne\'s ex-beau who still holds a flame for her. Acclaimed writer-director Francois Ozon (\"Swimming Pool,\" \"Under the Sand,\" \"Time to Leave,\") who had previously directed Ms. Deneuve in the international hit \"8 Women,\" twists the original play on its head to create his own satirical and hilarious take on the war between the sexes and classes. POTICHE reunites French cinema legends Catherine Deneuve and Gerard Depardieu in an ensemble cast that includes comic greats Fabrice Luchini and Karin Viard (as Luchini\'s secretary and mistress,) while Judith Godreche and Jeremie Renier play the Pujols\' entitled daughter and sexually ambiguous son. The impeccable 1970s era set design and costumes, were created by Katia Wyzkop and Pascaline Chavanne, respectively. -- (C) Music Box Films',NULL,'http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/15/61/11156155_mob.jpg'),(4560,'Pontypool',2008,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pontypool/','770790948','1226681',1,NULL,'Witty and restrained but still taut and funny, this Pontypool is a different breed of low-budget zombie film.','http://content9.flixster.com/movie/10/88/93/10889315_mob.jpg'),(4561,'Private Property (Nue propriete)',2006,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10007427-private_property/','770670032','0855895',1,NULL,'Private Property overcomes its slow pace with tight direction from Joachim Lafosse and an intriguing performance from Isabelle Huppert.','http://content9.flixster.com/movie/10/92/42/10924223_mob.jpg'),(4562,'The Pool',2007,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_pool/','770758980','0911024',1,NULL,'Beautifully crafted with loosely drawn characters and a lilting, natural pace, Chris Smith\'s The Pool features a universal message to which everyone can relate.','http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/88/91/10889180_mob.jpg'),(4563,'Permanent Midnight',1998,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/permanent_midnight/','14096','0120788',1,NULL,'Aimless storytelling undermines the gripping, unsettling subject of this film.','http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/91/85/10918516_mob.jpg'),(4564,'Pinocchio',2002,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1119026-pinocchio/','9737','0255477',1,NULL,'Roberto Benigni misfires wildly with this adaptation of Pinocchio, and the result is an unfunny, poorly-made, creepy vanity project.','http://content9.flixster.com/movie/25/24/252491_mob.jpg'),(4565,'Bloodworth',2011,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bloodworth_2010/','770815608','1421048',1,'It\'s been 40 years since E.F.

It\'s cheap and practical, and it\'s everywhere - even in our blood. But is it a danger to us? The plastic industry annually generates hundreds of billions of dollars. Every industrial sector in the world today is dependent on plastic. The amount of plastic we have produced since it was invented would be enough to cover the entire globe six times over. But this inexpensive and convenient substance comes with a hefty price. Plastic stays in the ground and water system for up to 500 years. It is found on every beach in the world. Numerous studies have proven that the chemicals it releases (such as Bisphenol A) migrate into the human body and may contribute to or cause grave health problems, from allergies to obesity to infertility, cancer and heart disease. For Austrian German director Werner Boote, plastic is personal. His grandfather was one of the early manufacturers of plastic and he introduced Boote at a young age to the magic substance that would change the world. Many years later, after reading about the global threat posed by plastic, he decides to embark on a quest to discover the truth about this pervasive substance. Traveling to fourteen countries, he boldly and humorously confronts manufacturers, scientists, government officials and consumers to ask questions that concern all of us: Why don\'t we change our consumption behavior? Why is the industry not reacting to apparent dangers? Who is held accountable for hills of garbage mounting in deserts and seas? Who wins in this game? And who loses? This feisty, informative documentary takes us on a journey around the globe - from the Moroccan Sahara to the middle of the Pacific Ocean, from a factory in China to the highest peaks of the Alps - to reveal the far-flung reaches of our plastic problem. Interviews with the world\'s foremost experts in biology, pharmacology, and genetics shed light on the perils of plastic to our environment and expose the truth of how plastic affects our bodies and the health of future generations. Interspersing animated sequences and old commercials, this eye-opening film reveals how the world has wholeheartedly embraced the convenience of a substance it knows nothing about. -- (C) First Run Features',NULL,'http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/15/43/11154340_mob.jpg'),(4567,'Outside Providence',1999,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/outside_providence/','13268','0125971',1,NULL,'Miscasted performers and humor miss the mark.','http://content8.flixster.com/movie/26/89/268914_mob.jpg'),(4568,'Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead',2007,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/poultrygeist-night-of-the-chicken-dead/','463146712','0462485',1,NULL,'Poultrygeist may be relentlessly tasteless and juvenile, but it\'s also a lively slice of schlocky fun.','http://content6.flixster.com/movie/95/95/34/9595344_mob.jpg'),(4569,'Price Check',2012,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/price_check_2011/','771266149','1845849',1,'Pete Cozy does his best juggling family life, rising debt and a dead end job, but when his new boss, Susan, a sexy, powerful, human dynamo shows up, Pete is pulled into the maelstrom that is her life and made to work harder than he ever has before.

The goal of his survey is to assess possible routes for a water canal from the region\'s only voluminous river. For many of the region\'s inhabitants, the canal will be a lifeline, the chance for a future and a source of hope. But for those living on the canal\'s direct course, it means only requisitions, departure, and loss. Many of the properties through which Renato passes will be flooded; many of the people and families will be relocated. As the fieldtrip progresses, it becomes clear that Renato shares something in common with the places he visits: emptiness, a sense of abandonment, and isolation. His geological research is slowly pervaded by a sensation of groundlessness, an incessant pining for his ex-wife, and a yearning to return home. But he presses ahead, continuing the trip in the hope that the voyage can somehow transmute his feelings.

With his rise to fame and money and his self-esteem issues, everything eventually took a toll on Ozzy as he embarked on an epic binge that would last 40 years.

An official selection at Cannes Film Festival-Un Certain Regard and winner of the Jury Prize, OCTUBRE is a deadpan dark comedy incorporating influences ranging from Jim Jarmusch and Aki Kaurismaki to Robert Bresson. An official selection at numerous international festivals, including Toronto, Palm Springs, Karlovy Vary, and the upcoming 2011 New Directors/New Films, OCTUBRE will open in New York at Lincoln Plaza Cinemas and Angelika Film Center on May 6. A national release will follow. October is the \"purple month\" in Lima, when the grey city\'s somber tones give way to processions celebrating the Lord of Miracles. Hope is reborn among the throngs of devotees who light candles and follow the processions, each in search of their own miracle. Tucked away in one of the Lima\'s modest flats lives Clemente, a small time loan shark with a penchant for reckless hookers, grave solitude, money lending and nothing else. Stuckin a shallow routine, Clemente lacks any real emotional connection to anyone. People, in turn, refer to him not by name, but as \"the pawnbroker\'s son.\" Whether it\'s a slippery counterfeiter, an amiable thief or a desperate neighbor, Clemente is sensitive only to what their business might bring him. Returning home one day, Clemente quickly realizes that an intruder has visited his home-not to steal from him, but instead to leave him with a little gift. Tucked in a small basket sitting on his bed Clemente finds a newborn baby, the product of one of his frequent liaisons with prostitutes. When Clemente finds himself ill-equipped for his new role, Sofia, one of his clients and an October worshipper, intervenes to help him take care of the baby while he goes in search of its mother. As the days stretch on, with Sofia and the baby sharing his home, Clemente discovers emotional attachments he never thought he had. And as seems fitting during the month of October, with its air of hope for better things, a once unpleasant, cold and lonely man named Clemente finds that his life is about to change. --(c) New Yorker',NULL,'http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/15/73/11157306_mob.jpg'),(4674,'The Orator (OLe Tulafale)',2011,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_orator_2011/','771259773',NULL,1,'Unassuming and small in stature, Saili lives a simple life with his beloved wife and teenage daughter in an isolated village on the islands of Samoa.

An 8-year-old schoolboy is so besotted with his teacher that he challenges her boyfriend to a duel to the death. (15 min.) GOD OF LOVE; USA; Oscar Nominee: Luke Matheny. Lounge-singing darts champion Raymond Goodfellow finds his prayers are answered -- literally -- when he receives a mysterious package of passion-inducing darts. The catch is that the one woman he loves -- Kelly, a drummer in his band -- is already in love with Ray\'s best friend Fozzie, the guitarist in the band. But when Ray uses the darts in a loony scheme to resolve this strange romantic triangle, he learns a surprising lesson about unrequited love and discovers his own place in the universe. Romance is in the air in this bohemian charmer. (18 min.) NA WEWE; Belgium; Oscar Nominee: Ivan Goldschmidt. 1994: There is civil war in Burundi, a small country of Central Africa directly bordering Rwanda. A near genocidal confrontation opposes rebels mainly composed of ethnic Hutus and a national army with a majority of Tutsis. This short film relates a sadly frequent episode of this fratricidal conflict: the attack by rebels of a minivan carrying ordinary citizens. A Kalashnikov bursts out. The bus stops, the passengers get off. An order is barked: \"Hutus to the left, Tutsis to the right!\" The sorting out begins. But who is a Hutu, who is a Tutsi? This story is entirely based on real people and situations. It was written by a person who has lived in the beauty of Burundi and suffered its horrors. With emotion, suspense and humor it exposes the absurdity of ethnic and racial strife. \"NA WEWE\" (pronounce \"Na wayway\") means \"You too\" in Kirundi. (19 min.) WISH 143; United Kingdom; Oscar Nominees: Ian Barnes and Samantha Waite. A fifteen-year-old boy with only months to live is granted one wish from the Dreamscape Charity.

Massina is a thoughtful sort and not especially impressed by the bragging and machismo of his shipmates.

While he sometimes spends his evenings with a woman, it\'s clear their relationship is not a close one. One day, Oscar gets word that grandfather has been transferred to a hospital, and his sister Maria (Veronica Echegui), who now lives in Paris, comes to Almeria to pay the old man a visit. Maria, who is expecting a baby, is accompanied by her boyfriend Jean (Denis Eyriey), who tries to keep a distance between the two siblings.

Arne Treholt was a celebrated Norwegian diplomat who in 1984 found himself disgraced when he was accused of selling state secrets to the highest bidder. Treholt was found guilty and spent eight years behind bars before he was pardoned and freed. Treholt has always insisted he was innocent of all charges, and in Kommandor Treholt & Ninjatroppen, Malling imagines a scenario in which Treholt (played by Mads Ousdal) is a ninja warrior with powers of invisibility who leads a secret fighting force protecting their homeland against Cold War foes, represented by the sinister Meyer (Jon Oigarden), whose sympathies are clearly with the United States. As Treholt and Meyer wage a private war for control of Norway\'s hearts and minds, Treholt tries to turn slobby slacker Humla (Amund Maarud) into a suitable second-in-command.

Simmons), from attending a Grateful Dead concert back in 1967, Gabriel Sawyer (Lou Taylor Pucci) packs his bags and runs away from home. Twenty years later, Henry and his wife, Helen (Cara Seymour), receive word that Gabriel has been diagnosed with a benign brain tumor that requires delicate surgery to remove. Though the operation is successful, Henry and Helen soon learn that the part of their son\'s brain responsible for creating memories has been damaged by the long-neglected tumor, and that as a result, Gabriel will find it difficult to distinguish the past from the present. As communication grows increasingly difficult, frustrated father Henry becomes staunchly determined to make up for lost time by forming a solid father-son bond with Gabriel, and begins researching treatment for brain injuries. It isn\'t long before Henry\'s inquiries lead him to music therapist Dr. Dianne Daly (Julia Ormond), whose innovative methods have yielded impressive results in the past. When Dr. Daily exposes Gabriel to the rock & roll music that he loved as a youth, something incredible begins to happen: Gabriel finally finds the words to express himself, and he regains the ability to have meaningful conversations. As his own health begins to take a turn for the worse, Henry determines to let go of his loathing for the music that has awakened his son\'s consciousness, and embrace the joy of loving the child he once drove away. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi','An involving, if sentimental and predictable family drama elevated by J.K.

When Ben Talbot (Simon Merrells) vanishes into thin air, his brother Lawrence (Benicio Del Toro) returns to his family estate to investigate.

Shortly after discovering his brother\'s true fate, Lawrence swears to Ben\'s wife, Gwen (Emily Blunt), that he will bring her late husband\'s killer to justice. As a young boy, the untimely death of his mother caused Lawrence to grow up before his time. Though Lawrence had previously attempted to bury his pain in the past by leaving the quiet Victorian hamlet of Blackmoor behind, he discovers that you can\'t outrun fate when he\'s attacked by the very same nocturnal beast that claimed his brother. Not even recently arrived Scotland Yard inspector Aberline (Hugo Weaving) can dream up a rational explanation for the gruesome spell cast over Blackmoor, yet rumors of an ancient curse persist.

As the years go by, Metro Man and Megamind develop an intense adversarial relationship that pits them in battle over Metro City time and again. Undeterred by his unbroken losing streak, Megamind hatches an ingenious scheme to finally destroy Metro Man by kidnapping pretty reporter Roxanne Ritchi (voice of Tina Fey), and luring the predictable hero into a deadly trap.

While the class goes through the healing process, nobody in the school is aware of Bachir\'s painful past; nor do they suspect that he is at risk of being deported at any moment. -- (C) Music Box','Monsieur Lahzar is a tender and thoughtful portrait of a man with hidden grief and also a compelling exploration of the teacher-student dynamic.','http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/35/11163580_mob.jpg'),(4971,'Mother (Madeo)',2009,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/madeo/','770809233','1216496',1,NULL,'As fleshy as it is funny, Bong Joon-Ho\'s Mother straddles family drama, horror and comedy with a deft grasp of tone and plenty of eerie visuals.','http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/12/76/11127689_mob.jpg'),(4972,'Mystery, Alaska',1999,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mystery_alaska/','12982','0134618',1,NULL,'The lack of hockey action and authenticity left critics cold.','http://content6.flixster.com/movie/26/75/267504_mob.jpg'),(4973,'Major League',1989,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/major_league/','13022','0097815',1,NULL,'Major League may be predictable and formulaic, but buoyed by the script\'s light, silly humor -- not to mention the well-built sports action sequences and funny performances.','http://content7.flixster.com/movie/26/77/267709_mob.jpg'),(4974,'My Life Without Me',2003,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/my_life_without_me/','14012',NULL,1,NULL,'Sarah Polley keeps this production afloat with her moving performance.','http://content7.flixster.com/movie/10/89/49/10894989_mob.jpg'),(4975,'Margot at the Wedding',2007,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/margot_at_the_wedding/','770673924','0757361',1,NULL,'Despite a great cast, the characters in Margot at the Wedding are too unlikable to enthrall viewers.','http://content8.flixster.com/movie/93/38/83/9338834_mob.jpg'),(4976,'Metropolis (Metoroporisu)',2001,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1111058-metropolis/','11593','0293416',1,NULL,'Even though the storyline is nothing new, Metropolis is an eye-popping visual treat.','http://content7.flixster.com/movie/10/93/38/10933865_mob.jpg'),(4977,'The Medallion',2003,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/medallion/','11888','0288045',1,NULL,'The use of special effects diminishes some of Chan\'s appeal in this disposable picture.','http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/78/11157837_mob.jpg'),(4978,'Mean Machine',2001,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1114210-mean_machine/','14442','0291341',1,NULL,'Despite some genuine wit, this crowd pleaser is filled with too many cliches.','http://content7.flixster.com/movie/27/46/274621_mob.jpg'),(4979,'Mindhunters',2005,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mindhunters/','18','0297284',1,NULL,'A retread of Ten Little Indians that lacks the source material\'s wit.','http://content6.flixster.com/movie/96/27/18/9627188_mob.jpg'),(4980,'All the King\'s Men',1949,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1000654-all_the_kings_men/','17384','0041113',1,NULL,'Broderick Crawford is spellbinding as politician Willie Stark in director Robert Rossen\'s adaptation of the Robert Penn Warren novel about the corrosive effects of power on the human soul.','http://content9.flixster.com/movie/28/76/287619_mob.jpg'),(4981,'Millions',2004,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/millions/','28','0366777',1,NULL,'A charming children fable even adults can enjoy.','http://content7.flixster.com/movie/24/97/249745_mob.jpg'),(4982,'Make It Happen',2008,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/make_it_happen/','770680850','0822868',1,NULL,'Cheap, predictable, formulaic and unimaginative generic dance film.

From storyboard artist Harold Michelson to art directors Robert Boyle, Henry Bumstead and Albert Nozaki to cinematographers Haskell Wexler and Conrad Hall, each one of them gets just the right amount of screen time so that you\'re able to understand precisely how they started out in the film industry, how they contributed to it and what makes them so important within the scope of the world of film. Neither of them comes across as full of themselves or boring; they\'re each wise, honest and charismatic. Albert Nozaki, who worked as the art director in such films as When Worlds Collide, the original War of the Worlds and The Ten Commandments , explains how even though his eyesight was poor back then, his boss at Paramount let him continue to work; on the day that the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, though, he was fired merely a few hours after the bombing, but returned to his job there after the war was over. He retired when he became completely blind in 1969 and died in 2003 at the age of 91. Robert Boyle worked as a production designer for a variety of classic films ranging from Saboteur to The Birds, North by Northwest, In Cold Blood, The Thomas Crown Affair and more. It\'s very fascinating to listen to him and storyboard artist Harold Michelson discussing what it was like to work on The Birds together and how a modern version of The Birds would probably leave virtually nothing to the imagination and have no subtleties unlike the original. They also give their two cents about how Hitchcock (referred to as \"Hitch\") would make films if he were alive today to utilize modern technology which he\'d probably use frequently, but only as a means of serving the story. Both Boyle and Michelson died at the age of 100 and 87, respectively. Production designer Henry Bumstead worked on To Kill a Mockingbird, Vertigo, The Sting and recent films such as Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima, and others, before dying at the age of 91. Haskell Wexler not only works as a cinematographer, but also as a director, writer and producer to this very day. His credits includeThe Thomas Crown Affair, Who\'s Afraid of Virginia Wolf?, Medium Cool which he also wrote/directed and produced, and most recently, he directed the documentary Who Needs Sleep?. Cinematographer Conrad L. Hall worked on such films as In Cold Blood, The Day of the Locusts, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Road to Perdition and others before his death at the age of 76. He explains his cinematography helped to highlight and reflect the human condition in In Cold Blood just like the other artists tried to do in the films they worked on as well at that time. Will there be another renaissance in the world of film? It\'s hard to say, but these six artists do believe that it\'s bound to come at some point. Director Daniel Raim deftly blends interviews with each of them along with select footage from their films and footage of them bonding as friends back in 2003. He asks important, provocative questions while wisely staying out of the film to keep the focus on them and their thoughts, feelings and some of their memories of the iconic renaissance period. In turn, Raim brings out their warmth, panache, wisdom and, occasionally, their sense of humor so that by the time the film\'s over, you\'re able to fully grasp them as humble, down-to-earth and sensitive human beings who ought to be remembered and appreciated by future generations for their persistence, brilliance, diligence and sense of camaraderie. At a running time of 1 hour and 20 minutes, Something\'s Gonna Live is engaging, honest and filled with warmth, insight and charisma. -- (C) Official Site',NULL,'http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/15/24/11152448_mob.jpg'),(5165,'Lawless',2014,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lawless_2014/','771260321',NULL,1,'Terrence Malick returns to the director\'s chair with this enigmatic production starring Ryan Gosling, Cate BLanchett, Christian Bale, {Haley Bennett}, and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\'s Rooney Mara.

Joseph Goebbels (Moritz Bleibtreu), Adolf Hitler\'s minister of propaganda, was a firm believer in the power of motion pictures, and in 1939 he wanted to make a film that would help shape public opinion against Jews in anticipation of the Nazi \"final solution.\" Goebbels was eager to make a movie based on the story of Joseph Suss Oppenheimer (1698-1738), a famous Jewish financier who gained power as an adviser to the Duke of Wurttemberg until he was implicated in a scandal by his enemies. While Oppenheimer\'s story has been the basis of several dramatic adaptations, Goebbels intended to give the story a strong anti-Semitic twist, and was determined to make it an artistic success. Goebbels saw up-and-coming actor Ferdinand Marian (Tobias Moretti) in a production of Othello and believed he was the perfect choice to play the Jew Suss. Marian was not interested in the role, but Goebbels was determined, and when he learned that Marian\'s wife Anna (Martina Gedeck) was Jewish and they had been protecting a Jewish colleague named Deutscher (Heribert Sasse), he used this information to force the actor to take the role. Goebbels encouraged Marian to make his performance a tour de force, and with the help of director Veit Harlan (Justus von Dohnanyi), the film became a major success in Germany and other Axis nations. But in years to come, Jew Suss would become an ugly legacy with terrible consequences for nearly everyone involved. Jud Suess: Film Ohne Gewissen (literally \"Jew Suss: Film Without Conscience,\" while the English language release title is Jew Suss: Rise and Fall) received its world premiere at the 2010 Berlin International Film Festival; Viet Harlan\'s 1940 film, meanwhile, is banned from public exhibition in Germany. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi',NULL,'http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/15/90/11159096_mob.jpg'),(5336,'The Jeffrey Dahmer Files',2013,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_jeffrey_dahmer_files/','771270468','1779076',1,'In 1991 Jeffrey Dahmer was arrested in Milwaukee and sentenced to 957 years in prison for killing 17 people and dismembering their bodies. \'Jeff\' explores the city of Milwaukee by meeting those surrounding Dahmer during and after his hidden spree.

Meanwhile, by constantly varying his methods, Kuklinski made it virtually impossible for investigators to assemble an accurate profile of the killer credited with taking over 100 lives. A protege of seasoned assassin Robert \"Mister Softee\" Pronge (Chris Evans), the elusive contract killer struggles to reconcile his relationship with his sociopathic brother Joseph (Stephen Dorff) while nurturing a close friendship with his Gambino contact Roy DeMeo (Ray Liotta). Then, in 1986, an arrest brings Kuklinski\'s violent career to a sudden end. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi',NULL,'http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/41/11164167_mob.jpg'),(5343,'The We and the I',2013,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_we_and_the_i/','771307426','1618445',1,'Set on the last day of the school year, THE WE AND THE I follows a group of Bronx high schoolers who board a city bus on their way home.

In I Am Comic, more than eighty professional comedians -- ranging from struggling beginners to veterans with over a fifty years of experience -- talk about the nuts and bolts of their work, discussing how they create their material, how an act comes together over time, the rigors of performing and their relationship with their audience. The film also focuses on one particular performer, Ritch Shydner. During the 1980s, Shydner was a working comedian who seemed poised for a major breakthrough -- he appeared on a number of top talk shows (including Johnny Carson, Jay Leno and David Letterman), he had his own special on HBO, he appeared on several situation comedies as a guest star and starred in several pilots for comedy shows built around him. Despite it all, Shydner never hit the big time, and he eventually quit touring to become a writer for television. After more than a decade away from the stage, Shydner is hoping to make a comeback, and Brady follows him as he tries to connect with a new audience and adjusts to the changing landscape of professional comedy. Featuring interviews with Phyllis Diller, Lewis Black, Sarah Silverman, Jeff Foxworthy, Dave Attell, Bobcat Goldthwait, Carlos Mencia and many more, I Am Comic received its world premiere at the 2010 Slamdance Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi',NULL,'http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/15/15/11151536_mob.jpg'),(5444,'Iron Island (Jazire Ahani)',2005,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/iron_island/','326392751','0472113',1,NULL,'A visually creative yet grounded film from Iran, Iron Island is a political allegory that packs a punch.','http://content6.flixster.com/movie/27/36/69/2736696_mob.jpg'),(5445,'Soar Into the Sun',2012,'http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/soar_into_the_sun/','771312450','2253742',1,'A South Korean Elite Black Eagles Air Force pilot Tae-hun finds himself transferred to a combat flying unit after a cocky, unplanned, and dangerous air show demonstration.
