2013-06-02 19:44:31,008 INFO  - 20.625862, The Life And Times Of The Red Dog Saloon, This documentary pays tribute to the contributions and importance of the title watering hole in the creation of the psychedelic dancehalls that littered the West during the late '60s and helped launch such super groups as The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and The Quicksilver Messenger Service. The Red Dog Saloon had its genesis in 1964 when a group of free-thinking, LSD-enhanced Northern California students and young folks had a party and began thinking about starting up a saloon that would evoke the old West. They decided to build their saloon in Virginia City, Nevada, a once prosperous town that was by then nearly empty. The ambience of the saloon blended Old West sensibilities with modern psychedelia, go-go girls, the origins of the light show and plenty of mind-altering substances. The film goes on to show how this dawn of psychedelic rock followed three of these free-spirits from the Red Dog back to the bay area, inspiring them to start a new project - The Family Dog. The film is comprised of interviews with surviving founders, actual archival footage, a history of the poster art of the era and performances of some of the musicians who appeared at the Red Dog and in the dancehalls of San Francisco.

2013-06-02 19:44:31,009 INFO  - 13.315878, Infiltration, Men who will never be soldiers still find themselves going through basic training in this period drama directed by Dover Kosashvili. It's 1956, and Israel requires mandatory military service of all its citizens. However, not everyone makes the grade to serve in the Army, and one company going through training for the Israeli Defense Force is made up entirely of men who are considered unfit for the conventional armed forces -- they have criminal records, suffer from a variety of physical ailments or have psychological issues that make them unreliable. However, the IDF is determined to turn them into some sort of fighting men, and the culturally and ethnically diverse band of would-be soldiers suffers through basic training together under the watch of the frequently angry Commander Benny (Michael Aloni). However, Benny is more successful at alienating his charges than making them heroes, and three in particular find themselves on his bad side. Ben Hamo (Assaf Ben Shimon) has become a target for abuse thanks to his Moroccan heritage and lack of machismo. Avner (Gay Adler) is a skirt-chasing slacker who would rather goof off than fight. And Alon (Oz Zehavi) is a seemingly healthy veteran of a kibbutz who insists with increasing ferocity that he's perfectly fit for the army. Based on a celebrated novel by Yehoshua Kenaz, Hitganvut Yehidim (aka Infiltration) was an official selection at the 2010 BFI London Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi

The World Masters Athletics Championships is an international competition for senior citizens, and the men and women who take the field are as strong and determined as any of their younger counterparts. Filmmaker Jan Tenhaven travels to the 2009 WMAC games in Lahti, Finland and profiles a handful of the athletes who have come to test their mettle in the documentary Herbstgold (aka Autumn Gold). Jiri Soukup is a high jumper from the Czech Republic; at the age of 82, he can still clear a meter, though his training makes his wife nervous. Ilse Pleuger, 85 years old and from Germany, is hoping to bring home a medal in the shot put, and has devoted herself to the sport with a new vigor since the passing of her husband. Herbert Liedtke is a runner from Sweden whose favored race the 100 Yard Dash; at 93 he still runs daily and is in the market for a new girlfriend. Alfred Proksch is 100 years old but is still throwing the discus in competitive events; at home in Austria, he devoted himself to painting, specializing in nude studies. And Gabre Gabric, from Italy, declines to state her age on camera, but displays no shyness about her ambitions for the games, hoping to best 13 meters in the discus throw. Autumn Gold received its world premiere at the 2010 Hot Docs International Documentary Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi

After escaping the Japanese occupation of his hometown of Fo Shan, China, Ip Man and his family have arrived in Hong Kong, which is living under the iron fist of British colonial rule. Ip wants to support his family by opening up a martial arts academy to teach his unique Wing Chun style. But a corrupt cabal of Hong Kong martial arts masters, led by Hung Chun-nam (the legendary Sammo Hung), refuses to allow Ip to teach until he proves himself - and prove himself he does, in an intense series of fights against the masters showcasing a dazzling variety of martial arts styles, culminating in a highly anticipated brawl between Ip and Hung atop a rickety table. But even after gaining the respect of the masters, Ip's troubles are far from over. Hong Kong under British rule is a world of corruption, and when a Western-style boxer named Taylor "Twister" Milos comes to town to entertain the British upper-class, and insults both Chinese martial arts and the native citizens in a horrifically violent way, Ip must step up and fight for the honor of both his kung fu and the Chinese people. Forced by honor to enter a brutal "King of the Ring" boxing match against Twister, it's East versus West in an amazing, knock-down drag-out fight to the finish, the likes of which have never been seen on-screen before. Presented in the original, un-dubbed and uncut, international version that's been breaking box-office records across Asia, Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster is a throwback to the golden age of Hong Kong martial arts cinema that will delight kung fu fans and newcomers alike. -- (C) Well Go USA and Variance

2013-06-02 19:44:31,010 WARN  - 20.625862, 6763, The Life And Times Of The Red Dog Saloon, This documentary pays tribute to the contributions and importance of the title watering hole in the creation of the psychedelic dancehalls that littered the West during the late '60s and helped launch such super groups as The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and The Quicksilver Messenger Service. The Red Dog Saloon had its genesis in 1964 when a group of free-thinking, LSD-enhanced Northern California students and young folks had a party and began thinking about starting up a saloon that would evoke the old West. They decided to build their saloon in Virginia City, Nevada, a once prosperous town that was by then nearly empty. The ambience of the saloon blended Old West sensibilities with modern psychedelia, go-go girls, the origins of the light show and plenty of mind-altering substances. The film goes on to show how this dawn of psychedelic rock followed three of these free-spirits from the Red Dog back to the bay area, inspiring them to start a new project - The Family Dog. The film is comprised of interviews with surviving founders, actual archival footage, a history of the poster art of the era and performances of some of the musicians who appeared at the Red Dog and in the dancehalls of San Francisco.

2013-06-02 20:00:34,239 INFO  - 20.625862, The Life And Times Of The Red Dog Saloon, This documentary pays tribute to the contributions and importance of the title watering hole in the creation of the psychedelic dancehalls that littered the West during the late '60s and helped launch such super groups as The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and The Quicksilver Messenger Service. The Red Dog Saloon had its genesis in 1964 when a group of free-thinking, LSD-enhanced Northern California students and young folks had a party and began thinking about starting up a saloon that would evoke the old West. They decided to build their saloon in Virginia City, Nevada, a once prosperous town that was by then nearly empty. The ambience of the saloon blended Old West sensibilities with modern psychedelia, go-go girls, the origins of the light show and plenty of mind-altering substances. The film goes on to show how this dawn of psychedelic rock followed three of these free-spirits from the Red Dog back to the bay area, inspiring them to start a new project - The Family Dog. The film is comprised of interviews with surviving founders, actual archival footage, a history of the poster art of the era and performances of some of the musicians who appeared at the Red Dog and in the dancehalls of San Francisco.

2013-06-02 20:00:34,240 INFO  - 13.315878, Infiltration, Men who will never be soldiers still find themselves going through basic training in this period drama directed by Dover Kosashvili. It's 1956, and Israel requires mandatory military service of all its citizens. However, not everyone makes the grade to serve in the Army, and one company going through training for the Israeli Defense Force is made up entirely of men who are considered unfit for the conventional armed forces -- they have criminal records, suffer from a variety of physical ailments or have psychological issues that make them unreliable. However, the IDF is determined to turn them into some sort of fighting men, and the culturally and ethnically diverse band of would-be soldiers suffers through basic training together under the watch of the frequently angry Commander Benny (Michael Aloni). However, Benny is more successful at alienating his charges than making them heroes, and three in particular find themselves on his bad side. Ben Hamo (Assaf Ben Shimon) has become a target for abuse thanks to his Moroccan heritage and lack of machismo. Avner (Gay Adler) is a skirt-chasing slacker who would rather goof off than fight. And Alon (Oz Zehavi) is a seemingly healthy veteran of a kibbutz who insists with increasing ferocity that he's perfectly fit for the army. Based on a celebrated novel by Yehoshua Kenaz, Hitganvut Yehidim (aka Infiltration) was an official selection at the 2010 BFI London Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi

The World Masters Athletics Championships is an international competition for senior citizens, and the men and women who take the field are as strong and determined as any of their younger counterparts. Filmmaker Jan Tenhaven travels to the 2009 WMAC games in Lahti, Finland and profiles a handful of the athletes who have come to test their mettle in the documentary Herbstgold (aka Autumn Gold). Jiri Soukup is a high jumper from the Czech Republic; at the age of 82, he can still clear a meter, though his training makes his wife nervous. Ilse Pleuger, 85 years old and from Germany, is hoping to bring home a medal in the shot put, and has devoted herself to the sport with a new vigor since the passing of her husband. Herbert Liedtke is a runner from Sweden whose favored race the 100 Yard Dash; at 93 he still runs daily and is in the market for a new girlfriend. Alfred Proksch is 100 years old but is still throwing the discus in competitive events; at home in Austria, he devoted himself to painting, specializing in nude studies. And Gabre Gabric, from Italy, declines to state her age on camera, but displays no shyness about her ambitions for the games, hoping to best 13 meters in the discus throw. Autumn Gold received its world premiere at the 2010 Hot Docs International Documentary Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi

After escaping the Japanese occupation of his hometown of Fo Shan, China, Ip Man and his family have arrived in Hong Kong, which is living under the iron fist of British colonial rule. Ip wants to support his family by opening up a martial arts academy to teach his unique Wing Chun style. But a corrupt cabal of Hong Kong martial arts masters, led by Hung Chun-nam (the legendary Sammo Hung), refuses to allow Ip to teach until he proves himself - and prove himself he does, in an intense series of fights against the masters showcasing a dazzling variety of martial arts styles, culminating in a highly anticipated brawl between Ip and Hung atop a rickety table. But even after gaining the respect of the masters, Ip's troubles are far from over. Hong Kong under British rule is a world of corruption, and when a Western-style boxer named Taylor "Twister" Milos comes to town to entertain the British upper-class, and insults both Chinese martial arts and the native citizens in a horrifically violent way, Ip must step up and fight for the honor of both his kung fu and the Chinese people. Forced by honor to enter a brutal "King of the Ring" boxing match against Twister, it's East versus West in an amazing, knock-down drag-out fight to the finish, the likes of which have never been seen on-screen before. Presented in the original, un-dubbed and uncut, international version that's been breaking box-office records across Asia, Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster is a throwback to the golden age of Hong Kong martial arts cinema that will delight kung fu fans and newcomers alike. -- (C) Well Go USA and Variance

2013-06-02 20:00:34,241 WARN  - 20.625862, 6763, The Life And Times Of The Red Dog Saloon, This documentary pays tribute to the contributions and importance of the title watering hole in the creation of the psychedelic dancehalls that littered the West during the late '60s and helped launch such super groups as The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and The Quicksilver Messenger Service. The Red Dog Saloon had its genesis in 1964 when a group of free-thinking, LSD-enhanced Northern California students and young folks had a party and began thinking about starting up a saloon that would evoke the old West. They decided to build their saloon in Virginia City, Nevada, a once prosperous town that was by then nearly empty. The ambience of the saloon blended Old West sensibilities with modern psychedelia, go-go girls, the origins of the light show and plenty of mind-altering substances. The film goes on to show how this dawn of psychedelic rock followed three of these free-spirits from the Red Dog back to the bay area, inspiring them to start a new project - The Family Dog. The film is comprised of interviews with surviving founders, actual archival footage, a history of the poster art of the era and performances of some of the musicians who appeared at the Red Dog and in the dancehalls of San Francisco.

2013-06-02 20:03:50,636 INFO  - 20.625862, The Life And Times Of The Red Dog Saloon, This documentary pays tribute to the contributions and importance of the title watering hole in the creation of the psychedelic dancehalls that littered the West during the late '60s and helped launch such super groups as The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and The Quicksilver Messenger Service. The Red Dog Saloon had its genesis in 1964 when a group of free-thinking, LSD-enhanced Northern California students and young folks had a party and began thinking about starting up a saloon that would evoke the old West. They decided to build their saloon in Virginia City, Nevada, a once prosperous town that was by then nearly empty. The ambience of the saloon blended Old West sensibilities with modern psychedelia, go-go girls, the origins of the light show and plenty of mind-altering substances. The film goes on to show how this dawn of psychedelic rock followed three of these free-spirits from the Red Dog back to the bay area, inspiring them to start a new project - The Family Dog. The film is comprised of interviews with surviving founders, actual archival footage, a history of the poster art of the era and performances of some of the musicians who appeared at the Red Dog and in the dancehalls of San Francisco.

2013-06-02 20:03:50,637 INFO  - 13.315878, Infiltration, Men who will never be soldiers still find themselves going through basic training in this period drama directed by Dover Kosashvili. It's 1956, and Israel requires mandatory military service of all its citizens. However, not everyone makes the grade to serve in the Army, and one company going through training for the Israeli Defense Force is made up entirely of men who are considered unfit for the conventional armed forces -- they have criminal records, suffer from a variety of physical ailments or have psychological issues that make them unreliable. However, the IDF is determined to turn them into some sort of fighting men, and the culturally and ethnically diverse band of would-be soldiers suffers through basic training together under the watch of the frequently angry Commander Benny (Michael Aloni). However, Benny is more successful at alienating his charges than making them heroes, and three in particular find themselves on his bad side. Ben Hamo (Assaf Ben Shimon) has become a target for abuse thanks to his Moroccan heritage and lack of machismo. Avner (Gay Adler) is a skirt-chasing slacker who would rather goof off than fight. And Alon (Oz Zehavi) is a seemingly healthy veteran of a kibbutz who insists with increasing ferocity that he's perfectly fit for the army. Based on a celebrated novel by Yehoshua Kenaz, Hitganvut Yehidim (aka Infiltration) was an official selection at the 2010 BFI London Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi

2013-06-02 20:03:50,637 INFO  - 12.30124, Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster, International megastar Donnie Yen reprises his iconic role as the real-life kung fu grandmaster Ip Man in this martial arts spectacular. After escaping the Japanese occupation of his hometown of Fo Shan, China, Ip Man and his family have arrived in Hong Kong, which is living under the iron fist of British colonial rule. Ip wants to support his family by opening up a martial arts academy to teach his unique Wing Chun style. But a corrupt cabal of Hong Kong martial arts masters, led by Hung Chun-nam (the legendary Sammo Hung), refuses to allow Ip to teach until he proves himself - and prove himself he does, in an intense series of fights against the masters showcasing a dazzling variety of martial arts styles, culminating in a highly anticipated brawl between Ip and Hung atop a rickety table. But even after gaining the respect of the masters, Ip's troubles are far from over. Hong Kong under British rule is a world of corruption, and when a Western-style boxer named Taylor "Twister" Milos comes to town to entertain the British upper-class, and insults both Chinese martial arts and the native citizens in a horrifically violent way, Ip must step up and fight for the honor of both his kung fu and the Chinese people. Forced by honor to enter a brutal "King of the Ring" boxing match against Twister, it's East versus West in an amazing, knock-down drag-out fight to the finish, the likes of which have never been seen on-screen before. Presented in the original, un-dubbed and uncut, international version that's been breaking box-office records across Asia, Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster is a throwback to the golden age of Hong Kong martial arts cinema that will delight kung fu fans and newcomers alike. -- (C) Well Go USA and Variance

2013-06-02 20:03:50,638 WARN  - 20.625862, 6763, The Life And Times Of The Red Dog Saloon, This documentary pays tribute to the contributions and importance of the title watering hole in the creation of the psychedelic dancehalls that littered the West during the late '60s and helped launch such super groups as The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and The Quicksilver Messenger Service. The Red Dog Saloon had its genesis in 1964 when a group of free-thinking, LSD-enhanced Northern California students and young folks had a party and began thinking about starting up a saloon that would evoke the old West. They decided to build their saloon in Virginia City, Nevada, a once prosperous town that was by then nearly empty. The ambience of the saloon blended Old West sensibilities with modern psychedelia, go-go girls, the origins of the light show and plenty of mind-altering substances. The film goes on to show how this dawn of psychedelic rock followed three of these free-spirits from the Red Dog back to the bay area, inspiring them to start a new project - The Family Dog. The film is comprised of interviews with surviving founders, actual archival footage, a history of the poster art of the era and performances of some of the musicians who appeared at the Red Dog and in the dancehalls of San Francisco.

2013-06-02 20:03:50,638 WARN  - 13.315878, 3045, Infiltration, Men who will never be soldiers still find themselves going through basic training in this period drama directed by Dover Kosashvili. It's 1956, and Israel requires mandatory military service of all its citizens. However, not everyone makes the grade to serve in the Army, and one company going through training for the Israeli Defense Force is made up entirely of men who are considered unfit for the conventional armed forces -- they have criminal records, suffer from a variety of physical ailments or have psychological issues that make them unreliable. However, the IDF is determined to turn them into some sort of fighting men, and the culturally and ethnically diverse band of would-be soldiers suffers through basic training together under the watch of the frequently angry Commander Benny (Michael Aloni). However, Benny is more successful at alienating his charges than making them heroes, and three in particular find themselves on his bad side. Ben Hamo (Assaf Ben Shimon) has become a target for abuse thanks to his Moroccan heritage and lack of machismo. Avner (Gay Adler) is a skirt-chasing slacker who would rather goof off than fight. And Alon (Oz Zehavi) is a seemingly healthy veteran of a kibbutz who insists with increasing ferocity that he's perfectly fit for the army. Based on a celebrated novel by Yehoshua Kenaz, Hitganvut Yehidim (aka Infiltration) was an official selection at the 2010 BFI London Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi

A close encounter of the third kind becomes a Jaws-style nightmare when an alien invades a spacecraft in Ridley Scott's sci-fi horror classic. On the way home from a mission for the Company, the Nostromo's crew is woken up from hibernation by the ship's Mother computer to answer a distress signal from a nearby planet. Capt. Dallas's (Tom Skerritt) rescue team discovers a bizarre pod field, but things get even stranger when a face-hugging creature bursts out of a pod and attaches itself to Kane (John Hurt). Over the objections of Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), science officer Ash (Ian Holm) lets Kane back on the ship. The acid-blooded incubus detaches itself from an apparently recovered Kane, but an alien erupts from Kane's stomach and escapes. The alien starts stalking the humans, pitting Dallas and his crew (and cat) against a malevolent killing machine that also has a protector in the nefarious Company.

The Red Dog Saloon had its genesis in 1964 when a group of free-thinking, LSD-enhanced Northern California students and young folks had a party and began thinking about starting up a saloon that would evoke the old West. They decided to build their saloon in Virginia City, Nevada, a once prosperous town that was by then nearly empty. The ambience of the saloon blended Old West sensibilities with modern psychedelia, go-go girls, the origins of the light show and plenty of mind-altering substances. The film goes on to show how this dawn of psychedelic rock followed three of these free-spirits from the Red Dog back to the bay area, inspiring them to start a new project - The Family Dog. The film is comprised of interviews with surviving founders, actual archival footage, a history of the poster art of the era and performances of some of the musicians who appeared at the Red Dog and in the dancehalls of San Francisco.

2013-06-02 20:05:26,157 INFO  - 13.315878, Infiltration, Men who will never be soldiers still find themselves going through basic training in this period drama directed by Dover Kosashvili. It's 1956, and Israel requires mandatory military service of all its citizens. However, not everyone makes the grade to serve in the Army, and one company going through training for the Israeli Defense Force is made up entirely of men who are considered unfit for the conventional armed forces -- they have criminal records, suffer from a variety of physical ailments or have psychological issues that make them unreliable. However, the IDF is determined to turn them into some sort of fighting men, and the culturally and ethnically diverse band of would-be soldiers suffers through basic training together under the watch of the frequently angry Commander Benny (Michael Aloni). However, Benny is more successful at alienating his charges than making them heroes, and three in particular find themselves on his bad side. Ben Hamo (Assaf Ben Shimon) has become a target for abuse thanks to his Moroccan heritage and lack of machismo. Avner (Gay Adler) is a skirt-chasing slacker who would rather goof off than fight. And Alon (Oz Zehavi) is a seemingly healthy veteran of a kibbutz who insists with increasing ferocity that he's perfectly fit for the army. Based on a celebrated novel by Yehoshua Kenaz, Hitganvut Yehidim (aka Infiltration) was an official selection at the 2010 BFI London Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi

After escaping the Japanese occupation of his hometown of Fo Shan, China, Ip Man and his family have arrived in Hong Kong, which is living under the iron fist of British colonial rule. Ip wants to support his family by opening up a martial arts academy to teach his unique Wing Chun style. But a corrupt cabal of Hong Kong martial arts masters, led by Hung Chun-nam (the legendary Sammo Hung), refuses to allow Ip to teach until he proves himself - and prove himself he does, in an intense series of fights against the masters showcasing a dazzling variety of martial arts styles, culminating in a highly anticipated brawl between Ip and Hung atop a rickety table. But even after gaining the respect of the masters, Ip's troubles are far from over. Hong Kong under British rule is a world of corruption, and when a Western-style boxer named Taylor "Twister" Milos comes to town to entertain the British upper-class, and insults both Chinese martial arts and the native citizens in a horrifically violent way, Ip must step up and fight for the honor of both his kung fu and the Chinese people. Forced by honor to enter a brutal "King of the Ring" boxing match against Twister, it's East versus West in an amazing, knock-down drag-out fight to the finish, the likes of which have never been seen on-screen before. Presented in the original, un-dubbed and uncut, international version that's been breaking box-office records across Asia, Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster is a throwback to the golden age of Hong Kong martial arts cinema that will delight kung fu fans and newcomers alike. -- (C) Well Go USA and Variance

2013-06-02 20:05:26,158 WARN  - 13.315878, 3045, Infiltration, Men who will never be soldiers still find themselves going through basic training in this period drama directed by Dover Kosashvili. It's 1956, and Israel requires mandatory military service of all its citizens. However, not everyone makes the grade to serve in the Army, and one company going through training for the Israeli Defense Force is made up entirely of men who are considered unfit for the conventional armed forces -- they have criminal records, suffer from a variety of physical ailments or have psychological issues that make them unreliable. However, the IDF is determined to turn them into some sort of fighting men, and the culturally and ethnically diverse band of would-be soldiers suffers through basic training together under the watch of the frequently angry Commander Benny (Michael Aloni). However, Benny is more successful at alienating his charges than making them heroes, and three in particular find themselves on his bad side. Ben Hamo (Assaf Ben Shimon) has become a target for abuse thanks to his Moroccan heritage and lack of machismo. Avner (Gay Adler) is a skirt-chasing slacker who would rather goof off than fight. And Alon (Oz Zehavi) is a seemingly healthy veteran of a kibbutz who insists with increasing ferocity that he's perfectly fit for the army. Based on a celebrated novel by Yehoshua Kenaz, Hitganvut Yehidim (aka Infiltration) was an official selection at the 2010 BFI London Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi

The World Masters Athletics Championships is an international competition for senior citizens, and the men and women who take the field are as strong and determined as any of their younger counterparts. Filmmaker Jan Tenhaven travels to the 2009 WMAC games in Lahti, Finland and profiles a handful of the athletes who have come to test their mettle in the documentary Herbstgold (aka Autumn Gold). Jiri Soukup is a high jumper from the Czech Republic; at the age of 82, he can still clear a meter, though his training makes his wife nervous. Ilse Pleuger, 85 years old and from Germany, is hoping to bring home a medal in the shot put, and has devoted herself to the sport with a new vigor since the passing of her husband. Herbert Liedtke is a runner from Sweden whose favored race the 100 Yard Dash; at 93 he still runs daily and is in the market for a new girlfriend. Alfred Proksch is 100 years old but is still throwing the discus in competitive events; at home in Austria, he devoted himself to painting, specializing in nude studies. And Gabre Gabric, from Italy, declines to state her age on camera, but displays no shyness about her ambitions for the games, hoping to best 13 meters in the discus throw. Autumn Gold received its world premiere at the 2010 Hot Docs International Documentary Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi

2013-06-02 20:05:26,158 WARN  - 12.30124, 2937, Zhui ying (Tracing Shadow), The fight for an elusive treasure map intensifies when a clueless landlord reveals that he has the item in his possession, and every kung-fu master in the region arrives hoping to claim it for themselves. In the midst of an intense battle within the Ming Palace, the treasure map that five kung-fu masters were fighting over vanishes without a trace. Years later, two of the masters who risked their lives for the map are running a modest bed and breakfast in a small village, their identities a secret to everyone who passes through. When their landlord inadvertently lets it slip that the map is in his possession, the fists start to fly all over again. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi
2013-06-02 20:05:26,158 WARN  - 12.30124, 1054, Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster, International megastar Donnie Yen reprises his iconic role as the real-life kung fu grandmaster Ip Man in this martial arts spectacular. After escaping the Japanese occupation of his hometown of Fo Shan, China, Ip Man and his family have arrived in Hong Kong, which is living under the iron fist of British colonial rule. Ip wants to support his family by opening up a martial arts academy to teach his unique Wing Chun style. But a corrupt cabal of Hong Kong martial arts masters, led by Hung Chun-nam (the legendary Sammo Hung), refuses to allow Ip to teach until he proves himself - and prove himself he does, in an intense series of fights against the masters showcasing a dazzling variety of martial arts styles, culminating in a highly anticipated brawl between Ip and Hung atop a rickety table. But even after gaining the respect of the masters, Ip's troubles are far from over. Hong Kong under British rule is a world of corruption, and when a Western-style boxer named Taylor "Twister" Milos comes to town to entertain the British upper-class, and insults both Chinese martial arts and the native citizens in a horrifically violent way, Ip must step up and fight for the honor of both his kung fu and the Chinese people. Forced by honor to enter a brutal "King of the Ring" boxing match against Twister, it's East versus West in an amazing, knock-down drag-out fight to the finish, the likes of which have never been seen on-screen before. Presented in the original, un-dubbed and uncut, international version that's been breaking box-office records across Asia, Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster is a throwback to the golden age of Hong Kong martial arts cinema that will delight kung fu fans and newcomers alike. -- (C) Well Go USA and Variance
