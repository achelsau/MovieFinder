The Red Dog Saloon had its genesis in 1964 when a group of free-thinking, LSD-enhanced Northern California students and young folks had a party and began thinking about starting up a saloon that would evoke the old West. They decided to build their saloon in Virginia City, Nevada, a once prosperous town that was by then nearly empty. The ambience of the saloon blended Old West sensibilities with modern psychedelia, go-go girls, the origins of the light show and plenty of mind-altering substances. The film goes on to show how this dawn of psychedelic rock followed three of these free-spirits from the Red Dog back to the bay area, inspiring them to start a new project - The Family Dog. The film is comprised of interviews with surviving founders, actual archival footage, a history of the poster art of the era and performances of some of the musicians who appeared at the Red Dog and in the dancehalls of San Francisco.

It's 1956, and Israel requires mandatory military service of all its citizens. However, not everyone makes the grade to serve in the Army, and one company going through training for the Israeli Defense Force is made up entirely of men who are considered unfit for the conventional armed forces -- they have criminal records, suffer from a variety of physical ailments or have psychological issues that make them unreliable. However, the IDF is determined to turn them into some sort of fighting men, and the culturally and ethnically diverse band of would-be soldiers suffers through basic training together under the watch of the frequently angry Commander Benny (Michael Aloni). However, Benny is more successful at alienating his charges than making them heroes, and three in particular find themselves on his bad side. Ben Hamo (Assaf Ben Shimon) has become a target for abuse thanks to his Moroccan heritage and lack of machismo. Avner (Gay Adler) is a skirt-chasing slacker who would rather goof off than fight. And Alon (Oz Zehavi) is a seemingly healthy veteran of a kibbutz who insists with increasing ferocity that he's perfectly fit for the army. Based on a celebrated novel by Yehoshua Kenaz, Hitganvut Yehidim (aka Infiltration) was an official selection at the 2010 BFI London Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi

The World Masters Athletics Championships is an international competition for senior citizens, and the men and women who take the field are as strong and determined as any of their younger counterparts. Filmmaker Jan Tenhaven travels to the 2009 WMAC games in Lahti, Finland and profiles a handful of the athletes who have come to test their mettle in the documentary Herbstgold (aka Autumn Gold). Jiri Soukup is a high jumper from the Czech Republic; at the age of 82, he can still clear a meter, though his training makes his wife nervous. Ilse Pleuger, 85 years old and from Germany, is hoping to bring home a medal in the shot put, and has devoted herself to the sport with a new vigor since the passing of her husband. Herbert Liedtke is a runner from Sweden whose favored race the 100 Yard Dash; at 93 he still runs daily and is in the market for a new girlfriend. Alfred Proksch is 100 years old but is still throwing the discus in competitive events; at home in Austria, he devoted himself to painting, specializing in nude studies. And Gabre Gabric, from Italy, declines to state her age on camera, but displays no shyness about her ambitions for the games, hoping to best 13 meters in the discus throw. Autumn Gold received its world premiere at the 2010 Hot Docs International Documentary Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi

After escaping the Japanese occupation of his hometown of Fo Shan, China, Ip Man and his family have arrived in Hong Kong, which is living under the iron fist of British colonial rule. Ip wants to support his family by opening up a martial arts academy to teach his unique Wing Chun style. But a corrupt cabal of Hong Kong martial arts masters, led by Hung Chun-nam (the legendary Sammo Hung), refuses to allow Ip to teach until he proves himself - and prove himself he does, in an intense series of fights against the masters showcasing a dazzling variety of martial arts styles, culminating in a highly anticipated brawl between Ip and Hung atop a rickety table. But even after gaining the respect of the masters, Ip's troubles are far from over. Hong Kong under British rule is a world of corruption, and when a Western-style boxer named Taylor "Twister" Milos comes to town to entertain the British upper-class, and insults both Chinese martial arts and the native citizens in a horrifically violent way, Ip must step up and fight for the honor of both his kung fu and the Chinese people. Forced by honor to enter a brutal "King of the Ring" boxing match against Twister, it's East versus West in an amazing, knock-down drag-out fight to the finish, the likes of which have never been seen on-screen before. Presented in the original, un-dubbed and uncut, international version that's been breaking box-office records across Asia, Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster is a throwback to the golden age of Hong Kong martial arts cinema that will delight kung fu fans and newcomers alike. -- (C) Well Go USA and Variance

The World Masters Athletics Championships is an international competition for senior citizens, and the men and women who take the field are as strong and determined as any of their younger counterparts. Filmmaker Jan Tenhaven travels to the 2009 WMAC games in Lahti, Finland and profiles a handful of the athletes who have come to test their mettle in the documentary Herbstgold (aka Autumn Gold). Jiri Soukup is a high jumper from the Czech Republic; at the age of 82, he can still clear a meter, though his training makes his wife nervous. Ilse Pleuger, 85 years old and from Germany, is hoping to bring home a medal in the shot put, and has devoted herself to the sport with a new vigor since the passing of her husband. Herbert Liedtke is a runner from Sweden whose favored race the 100 Yard Dash; at 93 he still runs daily and is in the market for a new girlfriend. Alfred Proksch is 100 years old but is still throwing the discus in competitive events; at home in Austria, he devoted himself to painting, specializing in nude studies. And Gabre Gabric, from Italy, declines to state her age on camera, but displays no shyness about her ambitions for the games, hoping to best 13 meters in the discus throw.

In the midst of an intense battle within the Ming Palace, the treasure map that five kung-fu masters were fighting over vanishes without a trace. Years later, two of the masters who risked their lives for the map are running a modest bed and breakfast in a small village, their identities a secret to everyone who passes through.

After escaping the Japanese occupation of his hometown of Fo Shan, China, Ip Man and his family have arrived in Hong Kong, which is living under the iron fist of British colonial rule. Ip wants to support his family by opening up a martial arts academy to teach his unique Wing Chun style. But a corrupt cabal of Hong Kong martial arts masters, led by Hung Chun-nam (the legendary Sammo Hung), refuses to allow Ip to teach until he proves himself - and prove himself he does, in an intense series of fights against the masters showcasing a dazzling variety of martial arts styles, culminating in a highly anticipated brawl between Ip and Hung atop a rickety table. But even after gaining the respect of the masters, Ip's troubles are far from over. Hong Kong under British rule is a world of corruption, and when a Western-style boxer named Taylor "Twister" Milos comes to town to entertain the British upper-class, and insults both Chinese martial arts and the native citizens in a horrifically violent way, Ip must step up and fight for the honor of both his kung fu and the Chinese people. Forced by honor to enter a brutal "King of the Ring" boxing match against Twister, it's East versus West in an amazing, knock-down drag-out fight to the finish, the likes of which have never been seen on-screen before. Presented in the original, un-dubbed and uncut, international version that's been breaking box-office records across Asia, Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster is a throwback to the golden age of Hong Kong martial arts cinema that will delight kung fu fans and newcomers alike. -- (C) Well Go USA and Variance

The Red Dog Saloon had its genesis in 1964 when a group of free-thinking, LSD-enhanced Northern California students and young folks had a party and began thinking about starting up a saloon that would evoke the old West. They decided to build their saloon in Virginia City, Nevada, a once prosperous town that was by then nearly empty. The ambience of the saloon blended Old West sensibilities with modern psychedelia, go-go girls, the origins of the light show and plenty of mind-altering substances. The film goes on to show how this dawn of psychedelic rock followed three of these free-spirits from the Red Dog back to the bay area, inspiring them to start a new project - The Family Dog. The film is comprised of interviews with surviving founders, actual archival footage, a history of the poster art of the era and performances of some of the musicians who appeared at the Red Dog and in the dancehalls of San Francisco.

It's 1956, and Israel requires mandatory military service of all its citizens. However, not everyone makes the grade to serve in the Army, and one company going through training for the Israeli Defense Force is made up entirely of men who are considered unfit for the conventional armed forces -- they have criminal records, suffer from a variety of physical ailments or have psychological issues that make them unreliable. However, the IDF is determined to turn them into some sort of fighting men, and the culturally and ethnically diverse band of would-be soldiers suffers through basic training together under the watch of the frequently angry Commander Benny (Michael Aloni). However, Benny is more successful at alienating his charges than making them heroes, and three in particular find themselves on his bad side. Ben Hamo (Assaf Ben Shimon) has become a target for abuse thanks to his Moroccan heritage and lack of machismo. Avner (Gay Adler) is a skirt-chasing slacker who would rather goof off than fight. And Alon (Oz Zehavi) is a seemingly healthy veteran of a kibbutz who insists with increasing ferocity that he's perfectly fit for the army.

Sukeban hantazu: Sokatsu nagurikomi sakusen), Asami returns exausted after three years of intense training to become a yakuza hunter. She decides to visit her old master, Inokuma (Sakichi Sato), who runs a bar. However, she finds his place in ruins and nothing is as it was when she left. As it turns out, the local yakuza had turned it into a gambling house and laid claim to the entire area with the help of a cold-blooded killer named Akira (Hitomi Miwa). Akira is relentless, and utilizes cruel tactics when anyone dares get in her way. Inokuma decides to hide Asami with the very first yakuza hunter, Miki (Yumi Yoshiyuki). However, in her dogged pursuit of the remaining yakuza hunters, Akira brutally murders Miki's family and burns down Inokuma's bar. Eventually, Asami's rage finally reaches its peak.

Directed by renowned filmmaker Emmett Malloy (THE WHITE STRIPES UNDER GREAT WHITE NORTHERN LIGHTS) this incredible new film captures nothing less than history in the making. Indie folk heroes Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros, Tennessee's Old Crow Medicine Show, and Britain's acclaimed Mumford & Sons, climbed aboard a beautiful vintage train in California, setting out for New Orleans, Louisiana on a "tour of dreams". The resulting film from this journey is nothing short of magical. Part road movie and part concert film, BIG EASY EXPRESS bears witness to the birth of a new musical era. With poignancy and beauty, Malloy documents these incredible musicians as they ride the rails and wow the crowds, from Oakland - to New Orleans. So climb on board for a vibrant, raucous, railway adventure. Filled with joyous crowds, late night laughter, endless music - and a train that was bound for glory.
2013-04-28 14:36:57,852 WARN  - 13.315878, 3045, Infiltration, Men who will never be soldiers still find themselves going through basic training in this period drama directed by Dover Kosashvili. It's 1956, and Israel requires mandatory military service of all its citizens. However, not everyone makes the grade to serve in the Army, and one company going through training for the Israeli Defense Force is made up entirely of men who are considered unfit for the conventional armed forces -- they have criminal records, suffer from a variety of physical ailments or have psychological issues that make them unreliable. However, the IDF is determined to turn them into some sort of fighting men, and the culturally and ethnically diverse band of would-be soldiers suffers through basic training together under the watch of the frequently angry Commander Benny (Michael Aloni). However, Benny is more successful at alienating his charges than making them heroes, and three in particular find themselves on his bad side. Ben Hamo (Assaf Ben Shimon) has become a target for abuse thanks to his Moroccan heritage and lack of machismo. Avner (Gay Adler) is a skirt-chasing slacker who would rather goof off than fight. And Alon (Oz Zehavi) is a seemingly healthy veteran of a kibbutz who insists with increasing ferocity that he's perfectly fit for the army. Based on a celebrated novel by Yehoshua Kenaz, Hitganvut Yehidim (aka Infiltration) was an official selection at the 2010 BFI London Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi

The World Masters Athletics Championships is an international competition for senior citizens, and the men and women who take the field are as strong and determined as any of their younger counterparts. Filmmaker Jan Tenhaven travels to the 2009 WMAC games in Lahti, Finland and profiles a handful of the athletes who have come to test their mettle in the documentary Herbstgold (aka Autumn Gold). Jiri Soukup is a high jumper from the Czech Republic; at the age of 82, he can still clear a meter, though his training makes his wife nervous. Ilse Pleuger, 85 years old and from Germany, is hoping to bring home a medal in the shot put, and has devoted herself to the sport with a new vigor since the passing of her husband. Herbert Liedtke is a runner from Sweden whose favored race the 100 Yard Dash; at 93 he still runs daily and is in the market for a new girlfriend. Alfred Proksch is 100 years old but is still throwing the discus in competitive events; at home in Austria, he devoted himself to painting, specializing in nude studies. And Gabre Gabric, from Italy, declines to state her age on camera, but displays no shyness about her ambitions for the games, hoping to best 13 meters in the discus throw. Autumn Gold received its world premiere at the 2010 Hot Docs International Documentary Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi

Master Gregory (Jeff Bridges) is a knight who had imprisoned the malevolently powerful witch, Mother Malkin (Julianne Moore), centuries ago. But now she has escaped and is seeking vengeance. Summoning her followers of every incarnation, Mother Malkin is preparing to unleash her terrible wrath on an unsuspecting world. Only one thing stands in her way: Master Gregory. In a deadly reunion, Gregory comes face to face with the evil he always feared would someday return. He has only until the next full moon to do what usually takes years: train his new apprentice, Tom Ward (Ben Barnes) to fight a dark magic unlike any other.

In the midst of an intense battle within the Ming Palace, the treasure map that five kung-fu masters were fighting over vanishes without a trace. Years later, two of the masters who risked their lives for the map are running a modest bed and breakfast in a small village, their identities a secret to everyone who passes through. When their landlord inadvertently lets it slip that the map is in his possession, the fists start to fly all over again. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi
2013-04-28 14:36:57,852 WARN  - 12.30124, 1054, Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster, International megastar Donnie Yen reprises his iconic role as the real-life kung fu grandmaster Ip Man in this martial arts spectacular. After escaping the Japanese occupation of his hometown of Fo Shan, China, Ip Man and his family have arrived in Hong Kong, which is living under the iron fist of British colonial rule. Ip wants to support his family by opening up a martial arts academy to teach his unique Wing Chun style. But a corrupt cabal of Hong Kong martial arts masters, led by Hung Chun-nam (the legendary Sammo Hung), refuses to allow Ip to teach until he proves himself - and prove himself he does, in an intense series of fights against the masters showcasing a dazzling variety of martial arts styles, culminating in a highly anticipated brawl between Ip and Hung atop a rickety table. But even after gaining the respect of the masters, Ip's troubles are far from over. Hong Kong under British rule is a world of corruption, and when a Western-style boxer named Taylor "Twister" Milos comes to town to entertain the British upper-class, and insults both Chinese martial arts and the native citizens in a horrifically violent way, Ip must step up and fight for the honor of both his kung fu and the Chinese people. Forced by honor to enter a brutal "King of the Ring" boxing match against Twister, it's East versus West in an amazing, knock-down drag-out fight to the finish, the likes of which have never been seen on-screen before. Presented in the original, un-dubbed and uncut, international version that's been breaking box-office records across Asia, Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster is a throwback to the golden age of Hong Kong martial arts cinema that will delight kung fu fans and newcomers alike. -- (C) Well Go USA and Variance

The Red Dog Saloon had its genesis in 1964 when a group of free-thinking, LSD-enhanced Northern California students and young folks had a party and began thinking about starting up a saloon that would evoke the old West. They decided to build their saloon in Virginia City, Nevada, a once prosperous town that was by then nearly empty. The ambience of the saloon blended Old West sensibilities with modern psychedelia, go-go girls, the origins of the light show and plenty of mind-altering substances. The film goes on to show how this dawn of psychedelic rock followed three of these free-spirits from the Red Dog back to the bay area, inspiring them to start a new project - The Family Dog. The film is comprised of interviews with surviving founders, actual archival footage, a history of the poster art of the era and performances of some of the musicians who appeared at the Red Dog and in the dancehalls of San Francisco.

It's 1956, and Israel requires mandatory military service of all its citizens. However, not everyone makes the grade to serve in the Army, and one company going through training for the Israeli Defense Force is made up entirely of men who are considered unfit for the conventional armed forces -- they have criminal records, suffer from a variety of physical ailments or have psychological issues that make them unreliable. However, the IDF is determined to turn them into some sort of fighting men, and the culturally and ethnically diverse band of would-be soldiers suffers through basic training together under the watch of the frequently angry Commander Benny (Michael Aloni). However, Benny is more successful at alienating his charges than making them heroes, and three in particular find themselves on his bad side. Ben Hamo (Assaf Ben Shimon) has become a target for abuse thanks to his Moroccan heritage and lack of machismo. Avner (Gay Adler) is a skirt-chasing slacker who would rather goof off than fight. And Alon (Oz Zehavi) is a seemingly healthy veteran of a kibbutz who insists with increasing ferocity that he's perfectly fit for the army. Based on a celebrated novel by Yehoshua Kenaz, Hitganvut Yehidim (aka Infiltration) was an official selection at the 2010 BFI London Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi

After escaping the Japanese occupation of his hometown of Fo Shan, China, Ip Man and his family have arrived in Hong Kong, which is living under the iron fist of British colonial rule. Ip wants to support his family by opening up a martial arts academy to teach his unique Wing Chun style. But a corrupt cabal of Hong Kong martial arts masters, led by Hung Chun-nam (the legendary Sammo Hung), refuses to allow Ip to teach until he proves himself - and prove himself he does, in an intense series of fights against the masters showcasing a dazzling variety of martial arts styles, culminating in a highly anticipated brawl between Ip and Hung atop a rickety table. But even after gaining the respect of the masters, Ip's troubles are far from over. Hong Kong under British rule is a world of corruption, and when a Western-style boxer named Taylor "Twister" Milos comes to town to entertain the British upper-class, and insults both Chinese martial arts and the native citizens in a horrifically violent way, Ip must step up and fight for the honor of both his kung fu and the Chinese people. Forced by honor to enter a brutal "King of the Ring" boxing match against Twister, it's East versus West in an amazing, knock-down drag-out fight to the finish, the likes of which have never been seen on-screen before. Presented in the original, un-dubbed and uncut, international version that's been breaking box-office records across Asia, Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster is a throwback to the golden age of Hong Kong martial arts cinema that will delight kung fu fans and newcomers alike. -- (C) Well Go USA and Variance

Years later, two of the masters who risked their lives for the map are running a modest bed and breakfast in a small village, their identities a secret to everyone who passes through.

After escaping the Japanese occupation of his hometown of Fo Shan, China, Ip Man and his family have arrived in Hong Kong, which is living under the iron fist of British colonial rule. Ip wants to support his family by opening up a martial arts academy to teach his unique Wing Chun style. But a corrupt cabal of Hong Kong martial arts masters, led by Hung Chun-nam (the legendary Sammo Hung), refuses to allow Ip to teach until he proves himself - and prove himself he does, in an intense series of fights against the masters showcasing a dazzling variety of martial arts styles, culminating in a highly anticipated brawl between Ip and Hung atop a rickety table. But even after gaining the respect of the masters, Ip's troubles are far from over. Hong Kong under British rule is a world of corruption, and when a Western-style boxer named Taylor "Twister" Milos comes to town to entertain the British upper-class, and insults both Chinese martial arts and the native citizens in a horrifically violent way, Ip must step up and fight for the honor of both his kung fu and the Chinese people. Forced by honor to enter a brutal "King of the Ring" boxing match against Twister, it's East versus West in an amazing, knock-down drag-out fight to the finish, the likes of which have never been seen on-screen before. Presented in the original, un-dubbed and uncut, international version that's been breaking box-office records across Asia, Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster is a throwback to the golden age of Hong Kong martial arts cinema that will delight kung fu fans and newcomers alike. -- (C) Well Go USA and Variance

The Red Dog Saloon had its genesis in 1964 when a group of free-thinking, LSD-enhanced Northern California students and young folks had a party and began thinking about starting up a saloon that would evoke the old West. They decided to build their saloon in Virginia City, Nevada, a once prosperous town that was by then nearly empty. The ambience of the saloon blended Old West sensibilities with modern psychedelia, go-go girls, the origins of the light show and plenty of mind-altering substances. The film goes on to show how this dawn of psychedelic rock followed three of these free-spirits from the Red Dog back to the bay area, inspiring them to start a new project - The Family Dog. The film is comprised of interviews with surviving founders, actual archival footage, a history of the poster art of the era and performances of some of the musicians who appeared at the Red Dog and in the dancehalls of San Francisco.

It's 1956, and Israel requires mandatory military service of all its citizens. However, not everyone makes the grade to serve in the Army, and one company going through training for the Israeli Defense Force is made up entirely of men who are considered unfit for the conventional armed forces -- they have criminal records, suffer from a variety of physical ailments or have psychological issues that make them unreliable. However, the IDF is determined to turn them into some sort of fighting men, and the culturally and ethnically diverse band of would-be soldiers suffers through basic training together under the watch of the frequently angry Commander Benny (Michael Aloni). However, Benny is more successful at alienating his charges than making them heroes, and three in particular find themselves on his bad side. Ben Hamo (Assaf Ben Shimon) has become a target for abuse thanks to his Moroccan heritage and lack of machismo. Avner (Gay Adler) is a skirt-chasing slacker who would rather goof off than fight. And Alon (Oz Zehavi) is a seemingly healthy veteran of a kibbutz who insists with increasing ferocity that he's perfectly fit for the army. Based on a celebrated novel by Yehoshua Kenaz, Hitganvut Yehidim (aka Infiltration) was an official selection at the 2010 BFI London Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi

Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) is a very ordinary man who is having a truly unusual day -- after discovering that one of his best friends, Ford Prefect (Mos Def), is actually an alien, Ford tells him that the planet Earth is going to be destroyed so that otherworldly forces can make room for construction of a hyperspace bypass.

A close encounter of the third kind becomes a Jaws-style nightmare when an alien invades a spacecraft in Ridley Scott's sci-fi horror classic. On the way home from a mission for the Company, the Nostromo's crew is woken up from hibernation by the ship's Mother computer to answer a distress signal from a nearby planet. Capt. Dallas's (Tom Skerritt) rescue team discovers a bizarre pod field, but things get even stranger when a face-hugging creature bursts out of a pod and attaches itself to Kane (John Hurt). Over the objections of Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), science officer Ash (Ian Holm) lets Kane back on the ship. The acid-blooded incubus detaches itself from an apparently recovered Kane, but an alien erupts from Kane's stomach and escapes. The alien starts stalking the humans, pitting Dallas and his crew (and cat) against a malevolent killing machine that also has a protector in the nefarious Company.

In addition to being filthy rich, billionaire industrialist Tony Stark is also a genius inventor. When Stark is kidnapped and forced to build a diabolical weapon, he instead uses his intelligence and ingenuity to construct an indestructible suit of armor and escape his captors. Once free, Stark discovers a deadly conspiracy that could destabilize the entire globe, and dons his powerful new suit on a mission to stop the villains and save the world. Gwyneth Paltrow co-stars as his secretary, Virginia "Pepper" Potts, while Terrence Howard fills the role of Jim "Rhodey" Rhodes, one of Stark s colleagues, whose military background leads him to help in the formation of the suit.

Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) is a very ordinary man who is having a truly unusual day -- after discovering that one of his best friends, Ford Prefect (Mos Def), is actually an alien, Ford tells him that the planet Earth is going to be destroyed so that otherworldly forces can make room for construction of a hyperspace bypass.

A close encounter of the third kind becomes a Jaws-style nightmare when an alien invades a spacecraft in Ridley Scott's sci-fi horror classic. On the way home from a mission for the Company, the Nostromo's crew is woken up from hibernation by the ship's Mother computer to answer a distress signal from a nearby planet. Capt. Dallas's (Tom Skerritt) rescue team discovers a bizarre pod field, but things get even stranger when a face-hugging creature bursts out of a pod and attaches itself to Kane (John Hurt). Over the objections of Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), science officer Ash (Ian Holm) lets Kane back on the ship. The acid-blooded incubus detaches itself from an apparently recovered Kane, but an alien erupts from Kane's stomach and escapes. The alien starts stalking the humans, pitting Dallas and his crew (and cat) against a malevolent killing machine that also has a protector in the nefarious Company.

In addition to being filthy rich, billionaire industrialist Tony Stark is also a genius inventor. When Stark is kidnapped and forced to build a diabolical weapon, he instead uses his intelligence and ingenuity to construct an indestructible suit of armor and escape his captors. Once free, Stark discovers a deadly conspiracy that could destabilize the entire globe, and dons his powerful new suit on a mission to stop the villains and save the world. Gwyneth Paltrow co-stars as his secretary, Virginia "Pepper" Potts, while Terrence Howard fills the role of Jim "Rhodey" Rhodes, one of Stark s colleagues, whose military background leads him to help in the formation of the suit. Jon Favreau directs, with Marvel movie veterans Avi Arad and Kevin Feige producing.

Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) is a very ordinary man who is having a truly unusual day -- after discovering that one of his best friends, Ford Prefect (Mos Def), is actually an alien, Ford tells him that the planet Earth is going to be destroyed so that otherworldly forces can make room for construction of a hyperspace bypass.

A close encounter of the third kind becomes a Jaws-style nightmare when an alien invades a spacecraft in Ridley Scott's sci-fi horror classic. On the way home from a mission for the Company, the Nostromo's crew is woken up from hibernation by the ship's Mother computer to answer a distress signal from a nearby planet. Capt. Dallas's (Tom Skerritt) rescue team discovers a bizarre pod field, but things get even stranger when a face-hugging creature bursts out of a pod and attaches itself to Kane (John Hurt). Over the objections of Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), science officer Ash (Ian Holm) lets Kane back on the ship. The acid-blooded incubus detaches itself from an apparently recovered Kane, but an alien erupts from Kane's stomach and escapes. The alien starts stalking the humans, pitting Dallas and his crew (and cat) against a malevolent killing machine that also has a protector in the nefarious Company.
2013-04-28 19:39:36,285 INFO  - 4.7871842, Iron Man, From Marvel Studios and Paramount Pictures comes Iron Man, an action-packed take on the tale of wealthy philanthropist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who develops an invulnerable robotic suit to fight the throes of evil. In addition to being filthy rich, billionaire industrialist Tony Stark is also a genius inventor. When Stark is kidnapped and forced to build a diabolical weapon, he instead uses his intelligence and ingenuity to construct an indestructible suit of armor and escape his captors. Once free, Stark discovers a deadly conspiracy that could destabilize the entire globe, and dons his powerful new suit on a mission to stop the villains and save the world. Gwyneth Paltrow co-stars as his secretary, Virginia "Pepper" Potts, while Terrence Howard fills the role of Jim "Rhodey" Rhodes, one of Stark s colleagues, whose military background leads him to help in the formation of the suit. Jon Favreau directs, with Marvel movie veterans Avi Arad and Kevin Feige producing.

2013-04-28 23:27:52,272 INFO  - 4.8520303, Alien, 'In space, no one can hear you scream.' A close encounter of the third kind becomes a Jaws-style nightmare when an alien invades a spacecraft in Ridley Scott's sci-fi horror classic. On the way home from a mission for the Company, the Nostromo's crew is woken up from hibernation by the ship's Mother computer to answer a distress signal from a nearby planet. Capt. Dallas's (Tom Skerritt) rescue team discovers a bizarre pod field, but things get even stranger when a face-hugging creature bursts out of a pod and attaches itself to Kane (John Hurt). Over the objections of Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), science officer Ash (Ian Holm) lets Kane back on the ship. The acid-blooded incubus detaches itself from an apparently recovered Kane, but an alien erupts from Kane's stomach and escapes. The alien starts stalking the humans, pitting Dallas and his crew (and cat) against a malevolent killing machine that also has a protector in the nefarious Company.

2013-04-28 23:27:52,312 INFO  - 3.465736, The Day After, A peaceful Midwestern city attempts to recover after it is destroyed by a nuclear missile strike in this powerful and deeply disturbing testament to the folly of pro-military hawks who believed that annihilation was a justifiable means of attaining power and control. The Day After originally aired on network television. At the end of the broadcast, many stations offered teams of counselors staffing 800 telephone numbers to help distraught viewers calm down.
2013-04-28 23:27:52,312 INFO  - 3.2425923, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams' oft-adapted tale of an normal guy making his way through the universe (it's already been presented as a novel, a radio serial, a television series, and a comic book) finally makes its way to the big screen in this endearingly goofy sci-fi comedy. Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) is a very ordinary man who is having a truly unusual day -- after discovering that one of his best friends, Ford Prefect (Mos Def), is actually an alien, Ford tells him that the planet Earth is going to be destroyed so that otherworldly forces can make room for construction of a hyperspace bypass.

With dashes of Kubrick, Vonnegut, and Dick, but a flavor entirely his own, Fassbinder tells the noir-spiked tale of reluctant action hero Fred Stiller (Klaus Lowitsch), a cybernetics engineer who uncovers a massive corporate and governmental conspiracy. At risk? Our entire (virtual) reality as we know it. This long unseen three-and-a-half-hour labyrinth is a satiric and surreal look at the weird world of tomorrow from one of cinema's kinkiest geniuses
2013-04-28 23:27:52,313 INFO  - 1.856298, Iron Man, From Marvel Studios and Paramount Pictures comes Iron Man, an action-packed take on the tale of wealthy philanthropist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who develops an invulnerable robotic suit to fight the throes of evil. In addition to being filthy rich, billionaire industrialist Tony Stark is also a genius inventor. When Stark is kidnapped and forced to build a diabolical weapon, he instead uses his intelligence and ingenuity to construct an indestructible suit of armor and escape his captors. Once free, Stark discovers a deadly conspiracy that could destabilize the entire globe, and dons his powerful new suit on a mission to stop the villains and save the world. Gwyneth Paltrow co-stars as his secretary, Virginia "Pepper" Potts, while Terrence Howard fills the role of Jim "Rhodey" Rhodes, one of Stark s colleagues, whose military background leads him to help in the formation of the suit. Jon Favreau directs, with Marvel movie veterans Avi Arad and Kevin Feige producing.

In the 26th century, the galaxy has been colonized by a military force known as the Alliance, but its leadership has not gone unquestioned.

2013-04-28 23:27:58,052 INFO  - 20.625862, The Life And Times Of The Red Dog Saloon, This documentary pays tribute to the contributions and importance of the title watering hole in the creation of the psychedelic dancehalls that littered the West during the late '60s and helped launch such super groups as The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and The Quicksilver Messenger Service. The Red Dog Saloon had its genesis in 1964 when a group of free-thinking, LSD-enhanced Northern California students and young folks had a party and began thinking about starting up a saloon that would evoke the old West. They decided to build their saloon in Virginia City, Nevada, a once prosperous town that was by then nearly empty. The ambience of the saloon blended Old West sensibilities with modern psychedelia, go-go girls, the origins of the light show and plenty of mind-altering substances. The film goes on to show how this dawn of psychedelic rock followed three of these free-spirits from the Red Dog back to the bay area, inspiring them to start a new project - The Family Dog. The film is comprised of interviews with surviving founders, actual archival footage, a history of the poster art of the era and performances of some of the musicians who appeared at the Red Dog and in the dancehalls of San Francisco.

2013-04-28 23:27:58,053 INFO  - 13.315878, Infiltration, Men who will never be soldiers still find themselves going through basic training in this period drama directed by Dover Kosashvili. It's 1956, and Israel requires mandatory military service of all its citizens. However, not everyone makes the grade to serve in the Army, and one company going through training for the Israeli Defense Force is made up entirely of men who are considered unfit for the conventional armed forces -- they have criminal records, suffer from a variety of physical ailments or have psychological issues that make them unreliable. However, the IDF is determined to turn them into some sort of fighting men, and the culturally and ethnically diverse band of would-be soldiers suffers through basic training together under the watch of the frequently angry Commander Benny (Michael Aloni). However, Benny is more successful at alienating his charges than making them heroes, and three in particular find themselves on his bad side. Ben Hamo (Assaf Ben Shimon) has become a target for abuse thanks to his Moroccan heritage and lack of machismo. Avner (Gay Adler) is a skirt-chasing slacker who would rather goof off than fight. And Alon (Oz Zehavi) is a seemingly healthy veteran of a kibbutz who insists with increasing ferocity that he's perfectly fit for the army. Based on a celebrated novel by Yehoshua Kenaz, Hitganvut Yehidim (aka Infiltration) was an official selection at the 2010 BFI London Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi

Filmmaker Jan Tenhaven travels to the 2009 WMAC games in Lahti, Finland and profiles a handful of the athletes who have come to test their mettle in the documentary Herbstgold (aka Autumn Gold).

Ilse Pleuger, 85 years old and from Germany, is hoping to bring home a medal in the shot put, and has devoted herself to the sport with a new vigor since the passing of her husband. Herbert Liedtke is a runner from Sweden whose favored race the 100 Yard Dash; at 93 he still runs daily and is in the market for a new girlfriend. Alfred Proksch is 100 years old but is still throwing the discus in competitive events; at home in Austria, he devoted himself to painting, specializing in nude studies. And Gabre Gabric, from Italy, declines to state her age on camera, but displays no shyness about her ambitions for the games, hoping to best 13 meters in the discus throw.

Years later, two of the masters who risked their lives for the map are running a modest bed and breakfast in a small village, their identities a secret to everyone who passes through. When their landlord inadvertently lets it slip that the map is in his possession, the fists start to fly all over again. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi
2013-04-28 23:27:58,054 INFO  - 12.30124, Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster, International megastar Donnie Yen reprises his iconic role as the real-life kung fu grandmaster Ip Man in this martial arts spectacular. After escaping the Japanese occupation of his hometown of Fo Shan, China, Ip Man and his family have arrived in Hong Kong, which is living under the iron fist of British colonial rule. Ip wants to support his family by opening up a martial arts academy to teach his unique Wing Chun style. But a corrupt cabal of Hong Kong martial arts masters, led by Hung Chun-nam (the legendary Sammo Hung), refuses to allow Ip to teach until he proves himself - and prove himself he does, in an intense series of fights against the masters showcasing a dazzling variety of martial arts styles, culminating in a highly anticipated brawl between Ip and Hung atop a rickety table. But even after gaining the respect of the masters, Ip's troubles are far from over. Hong Kong under British rule is a world of corruption, and when a Western-style boxer named Taylor "Twister" Milos comes to town to entertain the British upper-class, and insults both Chinese martial arts and the native citizens in a horrifically violent way, Ip must step up and fight for the honor of both his kung fu and the Chinese people. Forced by honor to enter a brutal "King of the Ring" boxing match against Twister, it's East versus West in an amazing, knock-down drag-out fight to the finish, the likes of which have never been seen on-screen before. Presented in the original, un-dubbed and uncut, international version that's been breaking box-office records across Asia, Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster is a throwback to the golden age of Hong Kong martial arts cinema that will delight kung fu fans and newcomers alike. -- (C) Well Go USA and Variance

2013-04-28 23:27:58,054 WARN  - 20.625862, 6763, The Life And Times Of The Red Dog Saloon, This documentary pays tribute to the contributions and importance of the title watering hole in the creation of the psychedelic dancehalls that littered the West during the late '60s and helped launch such super groups as The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and The Quicksilver Messenger Service. The Red Dog Saloon had its genesis in 1964 when a group of free-thinking, LSD-enhanced Northern California students and young folks had a party and began thinking about starting up a saloon that would evoke the old West. They decided to build their saloon in Virginia City, Nevada, a once prosperous town that was by then nearly empty. The ambience of the saloon blended Old West sensibilities with modern psychedelia, go-go girls, the origins of the light show and plenty of mind-altering substances. The film goes on to show how this dawn of psychedelic rock followed three of these free-spirits from the Red Dog back to the bay area, inspiring them to start a new project - The Family Dog. The film is comprised of interviews with surviving founders, actual archival footage, a history of the poster art of the era and performances of some of the musicians who appeared at the Red Dog and in the dancehalls of San Francisco.

2013-04-28 23:27:58,054 WARN  - 13.315878, 3045, Infiltration, Men who will never be soldiers still find themselves going through basic training in this period drama directed by Dover Kosashvili. It's 1956, and Israel requires mandatory military service of all its citizens. However, not everyone makes the grade to serve in the Army, and one company going through training for the Israeli Defense Force is made up entirely of men who are considered unfit for the conventional armed forces -- they have criminal records, suffer from a variety of physical ailments or have psychological issues that make them unreliable. However, the IDF is determined to turn them into some sort of fighting men, and the culturally and ethnically diverse band of would-be soldiers suffers through basic training together under the watch of the frequently angry Commander Benny (Michael Aloni). However, Benny is more successful at alienating his charges than making them heroes, and three in particular find themselves on his bad side. Ben Hamo (Assaf Ben Shimon) has become a target for abuse thanks to his Moroccan heritage and lack of machismo. Avner (Gay Adler) is a skirt-chasing slacker who would rather goof off than fight. And Alon (Oz Zehavi) is a seemingly healthy veteran of a kibbutz who insists with increasing ferocity that he's perfectly fit for the army. Based on a celebrated novel by Yehoshua Kenaz, Hitganvut Yehidim (aka Infiltration) was an official selection at the 2010 BFI London Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi

The World Masters Athletics Championships is an international competition for senior citizens, and the men and women who take the field are as strong and determined as any of their younger counterparts. Filmmaker Jan Tenhaven travels to the 2009 WMAC games in Lahti, Finland and profiles a handful of the athletes who have come to test their mettle in the documentary Herbstgold (aka Autumn Gold). Jiri Soukup is a high jumper from the Czech Republic; at the age of 82, he can still clear a meter, though his training makes his wife nervous. Ilse Pleuger, 85 years old and from Germany, is hoping to bring home a medal in the shot put, and has devoted herself to the sport with a new vigor since the passing of her husband. Herbert Liedtke is a runner from Sweden whose favored race the 100 Yard Dash; at 93 he still runs daily and is in the market for a new girlfriend. Alfred Proksch is 100 years old but is still throwing the discus in competitive events; at home in Austria, he devoted himself to painting, specializing in nude studies. And Gabre Gabric, from Italy, declines to state her age on camera, but displays no shyness about her ambitions for the games, hoping to best 13 meters in the discus throw. Autumn Gold received its world premiere at the 2010 Hot Docs International Documentary Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi
